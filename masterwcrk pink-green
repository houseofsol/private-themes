<p><center><h3>general conduct on the blog&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>
<p>Anon hate will be deleted without commentary, full stop. the feature, as well as my submission box, are currently enabled but I will not hesitate to close them & leave them off. I've seen how ugly things can get, & i don't play those games. my inbox is where hate goes to die tbh.

<p>additionally, <b>I DO NOT ACCEPT ANONYMOUS CRITIQUE</b> of my portrayal, my blog, or myself. I am more than happy to accept critique given off anon - it's how I grow & expand my abilities as a writer. I find that the anon feature enables more <i>CRUELTY</i> than it does productivity or constructive criticism, ergo without a face, it's just mean wrapped up in gift wrapping labeled "helpful."

<p>the anon feature is solely enabled for partners using sideblogs, or who have multiple blogs & may not happen to be logged into their blog of choice when they see a meme they want to send. if an ask <b>does not</b> have a URL associated with it, then I will likely delete it without publishing.

<p>this blog does not partake in discourse. I don't mind seeing it on the dash, but I <b>will not contribute to it</b> in any way, shape, or form, on my RP blogs as a matter of personal comfort. if you happen to have the link for <i>my personal blog</i>, you can find many of my thoughts, feelings, & opinions on a broad spectrum of meta - both fandom & rpc-centric - there.

<p>I practice <b>categorical denial of subtext</b> - I will not respond to passive aggression, silent treatment, guilt tripping, or other related behaviors - full stop. It’s 2020. I’m no longer tolerating this behavior in myself, & I will no longer tolerate it in others, either. If we can not communicate openly & respectfully, <b>then we will not communicate</b>.

<blockquote>
    <p>this additionally pertains to <b>exclusivity</b>. I will make no assumptions, & I ask for none in return - if there is a month or more of no ic interaction & no communication ooc pertaining to why, I reserve the right to open the spot up to someone else.
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, <b>I do not accept ANONYMOUS COMMENTARY OF ANY SORT</b> regarding my partners. if there is valid reason to believe someone seen on this blog is problematic, please come to me off anon - otherwise I have to assume there's an ulterior & shady motive, & will ignore it. tl;dr: start drama with me about my friends? <b>BLOCK ME NOW - WE ARE DONE</b>.

<p>For this same reason, this blog is currently MUTUALS ONLY. I am always down for exploring new plots & interactions - if we aren’t mutuals, you are still welcome to approach me with a plot if you have an idea for how our muses might interact. 

<p>There will be mature content on this blog, making it 18+ only.  If you do not list your (the mun) age on your blog, I will not follow you.
<br /><br />

<p><center><h3>disclaimer & general information&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>
<p>This blog is a private & highly selective writing & graphics blog for <b>CLARISSA ADELE FAIRCHILD</B> of <i>the shadowhunter chronicles</i>. I don’t own her canon, & make no claim as such however her verses & portrayal are my own. My portrayal of Clary is heavily steeped in divergency & headcanons, meaning she may react with some amount of nuanced difference than how she might within the constraints of pure canon. This is especially notable in her <b>variant verses</b>.

<br /><br />

<blockquote>
    <p><i>most important</i>: I will not change my interpretation of my muse just because it's "convenient" for an interaction. If I start noticing that you’re ignoring parts of my character's canon because you don’t like it/don’t agree with it, I reserve the right to drop all threads without warning. I don’t write as much as I do on my character to have it treated like it’s optional.
</blockquote>

<p><center>while the above seems very harsh, this has been a significant problem for me on my other blogs so I've learned it's something I just cannot tolerate.</center>

<p><center><h3>regarding writing & interaction&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>
<p>This blog is <b>PRIVATE & HIGHLY SELECTIVE</b>. it is also very <b>PLOT INTENSIVE</b>. I am open to both canon sources, multifandom crossovers, & original characters - I just prefer that blogs have a <i>RULES PAGE</i> somewhere I can find, as well as <b>AN ABOUT PAGE</b>. this is especially important for blogs outside of my canon familiarity & OCs - otherwise I may not know how to interact with you adequately.

<p>my preferred style is multi para* & novella (at least 2-4 paragraphs (~400+ words) vs. anything over 1-1.5k word length.) I primarily use icons & small text in terms of formatting, as well as <b>THIRD PERSON PRESENT TENSE</b>. 

<div id="left"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pEMRlHI.png"> <i>important!</i> <b>please do not send me "wanna rp?"</b> - instead, toss me a few plots you've been craving to start stuff between our muses. I also have plotting calls, & memes. I prefer intensively exploring chemistry between muses, & 'wanna rp?' doesn't really give me very much to work with. </div>
<br />
<div id="left"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pEMRlHI.png"> <i>important!</i> I unfollow people periodically -- if I do, it's likely because of inactivity (inactive 2+ months), or if you become exclusive with a version of my muse. I very rarely unfollow for any specific reason, but <b>UNTAGGED NSFW, EXCESSIVE GORE, TRANSPHOBIA, NAZISM, PEDOPHILIA, ANTISEMITISM & RACISM</b> are the big ones. I will unfollow & block for the last five.  </div>
<br /><br />

<p><center><h3>blog schedule & general activity&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>
<p>I run several RP blogs & work full time, so sometimes it’s a hot-buttered minute before I can get to things. I am entirely fine with someone coming to me about activity, especially if there’s a chance I might’ve missed a draft, etc, I only ask that it’s respectful. My day to be singularly devoted to the multi’s <b>LONGER THREADS</b> & in-depth interactions are <i>FRIDAYS</i>. I currently run all of my blogs on a queue to keep activity consistent as well as to take the pressure off myself & my partners for timely replies. 

<p>when I'm not on the dash, you can find me through my <a href="https://mangohub.tumblr.com/">rp hub</a>, or on discord.
<br /><br />

<p><center><h3>shipping (romantic & platonic)&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>
<p><b>ROMANTIC:</b> I ship <i>chemistry</i>. I write Clary as biromantic, bisexual, but still require a fairly significant amount of plotting to establish relationships.

<p><b>PLATONIC:</b>  I am more than excited to explore familial & platonic relationships with all of my muses. This blog is also <b>familial OC friendly</b>, I just ask that we plot things first so I have an idea of how they may fit into my different divergences, or interactions with my muse.

<p>some canon/canon involved ships you may see on this blog include <b>clace, climon</b>, & <b>clizzy</b>.
<br /><br />


<p><center><h3>mains & exclusives&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3></center>
<p><b>EXCLUSIVES:</b> these are the only interpretation of a portrayal I will interact with currently. I am comfortable with this given a history of extensive communication, well developed & fleshed out plots, & a solid relationship with the muns. 

<p><b>MAINS:</b> these are the muses muses i will go to first when it comes to plots & threads, but am NOT exclusive with.

<p>You can find the specifics of these two categories <b>per muse</b> on their extended information popups, as well as <b>pan-blog exclusivity</b> on the accompanying tab on this page.

<div id="left"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pEMRlHI.png"> <i>important!</i> all exclusives have ooc communication as a cornerstone. I recognize that life becomes busy as hell - however, if we go a month or more without <b>ANY FORM OF INTERACTION IC OR OOC</b>, i reserve the right to remove someone from the list & open the spot up to another so we can both explore new dynamics.  </div>

<center><h3>regarding her appearance</h3></center>
<p>- She is often said to look almost exactly like Jocelyn—with their green eyes, curly red hair, slender figure, small chest & narrow hips—though she does not see it, nor does she see the beauty others often see in her. There was a time when Clary felt herself to be a smaller, less beautiful, & more childlike version of her mother, although most people disagree. She is quite short, just a little over five feet tall, has hair she considers carrot-colored, & "a face full of freckles."
<p>- It is mentioned a few times that she dresses in a boyish & unfashionable ensemble, wearing oversized T-shirts, jeans & sneakers, which sometimes annoys Isabelle, who then picks out nicer, or more fashionably trendy clothes for her to wear. Through Isabelle's influence, she slowly shed her usually boyish fashion & began to put an effort into fixing herself up more often. She is told by a few guys to be cute or beautiful, despite what she personally thinks of herself. Jace (as seen in bonus material from his view) is also shown to find her beautiful as well as fierce & says that Clary, unlike other girls, just doesn't know it.
<p>- Clary, like the Herondale men & Jocelyn, has a white star-shaped scar; Clary's is on her shoulder. All of them received their scars because of their contact with the angel Ithuriel. Unlike the rest of them, Clary received her scar because she was born with Ithuriel's angel blood in her veins through Valentine's experiments.

<center><h3>notes on the show</h3></center>
<p>- had just turned 18, however the program she was accepted to was a summer art program.
    
    <p>- much like in the movie, Clary began drawing elements of the Shadow World & being a Shadowhunter, like runes & demons.
    
    <p>- There are several occupants at the Institute carrying out missions. The Institute is much more modern & has several computers & high-tech equipment, some of which is used to track demon activity. I <i>like</i> that the Institutes are busier, so this will be my default - however I'm more than happy to plot this out or work with exclusively book canon.
    
    <p>- As long as vampires are accompanied by Shadowhunters to get past the wards, they can easily enter the Institute.
    
    <p>- Clary & Isabelle went to the Citadel on a mission for the Clave to know what Valentine could want with the Mortal Sword & thus his plans with it. 
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>- <b>Max</b>. All plotting regarding Max Lightwood will be established on a case-by-case basis.
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>- Clary can draw portal runes in midair.
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>- Regarding Clary or Jace being bound to Jonathan, <b>I am open to either with plotting</b>.
        
        <p>- Regarding Clary & <i>parabatai</i>, in any verse she has one, it will be Simon unless plotted otherwise.
        
        <p>- Regarding Luke, I am open to either book canon where he never becomes a Shadowhunter again, <i>or</i> the show canon where Luke re-became Shadowhunter after injecting himself with Aldertree's serum of heavenly fire. <b>plotting dependent</b>.
        
        <p>- Regarding the ending of <i>Freeform's Shadowhunters</i>, I do not acknowledge Clary losing her memories or runes.

<br />

<center><h3>abilities</h3></center>
<p><b>Nephilim physiology</b>: Being Nephilim, Clary possesses a myriad of enhanced physical & mental abilities granted to her by the blood of Raziel in her veins & also by the angelic Marks of the Gray Book. This includes enhanced strength, agility, stamina, coordination, & many others which improve over time & practice.

<p><b>Runic magic</b>: Due to the angel Raziel's blood in their veins, all Shadowhunters are able to apply runes on their skin without any real danger. These Marks, in turn, give varied effects that serve to benefit the wearer.

<p><b>Angelic blood empowerment</b>: While all Shadowhunters have the angel Raziel's blood in them, Clary has more; particularly, she was given the blood of Ithuriel in her mother's womb due to Valentine's experiments. Because of this, she became partially linked to Ithuriel, who, when the need arose, sent her prophetic dreams & visions of the future, as well as images of long-forgotten runes, or runes not in the Gray Book & known only to angels, which she is able to recreate & use. She can also enhance the potency of common runes to make them more powerful than usual. She also possesses the unique ability to transform objects into art on paper, which can be transformed back.

<p><b>The Sight</b>: As a Shadowhunter, Clary is able to easily see through most magical illusions & layers of glamour over reality. Because of her years being raised as a mundane—and the years when she had a block on her Sight, which eventually needed more —she needed some training for this in the beginning & struggled slightly.
Use of heavenly weapons: As a Nephilim, Clary is also able to handle heavenly weapons with effect, since this would normally not work for other species. In particular, these are weapons made of adamas & forged by Iron Sisters, such as seraph blades.

<p><b>Art</b>: Clary is a particularly gifted & talented artist.

<center><h3>Early Life // from book canon</h3></center>
<div id="bio"><p>Clarissa Adele Morgenstern was born to Valentine & Jocelyn Morgenstern on August 23, roughly a year after her older brother, Jonathan. Jocelyn gave her the middle name "Adele" to honor her own mother.

<p>Jocelyn had turned against Valentine's ideals months before her conception. During the time after Jonathan's birth, Jocelyn suffered depression because of her strange feelings of rejection towards him. Hoping to help Jocelyn, Valentine secretly gave her doses of the angel Ithuriel's blood, hoping to "cure" her depression, unaware that she was pregnant with Clary, therefore making her an "accidental" experiment.

<p>Eventually, Jocelyn & her best friend Lucian Graymark began to plot to thwart Valentine's planned Uprising. Jocelyn, upon finding out that she was pregnant with Clary, had wanted to leave Valentine but feared that he would come after them & knew that he had to die to guarantee their safety. When the Uprising came & Jocelyn was able to steal the Cup from Valentine, they ran, but without Clary's older brother as Valentine had made it look like the child died in a fire with him. Jocelyn wasn't confident about Valentine's death, however suspecting that he was only in hiding, & fled to Paris, & later New York City; ran from the Shadowhunter world & culture, away from her past, & raised Clary as a mundane.

<center><b>special note</b></center>

<blockquote>
    <p>I fully support both book!Luke & show!Luke - just let me know during plotting so I know which canon to pull from for interactions.
</blockquote>

<p>Jocelyn hoped that Clary would have a blind Inner Eye, meaning she'd need to be trained like some Shadowhunters to see the Shadow World. When she was around two years old, however, Jocelyn found her playing with a faerie in the park, & she promptly took her to the warlock, Magnus Bane. There, she first also met Tessa Gray. Jocelyn asked Magnus to remove her Inner Eye, but this would have put her at risk, so they compromised with a spell that placed a block on her mind that would make her forget what she saw of the Shadow World even as she saw it, but the spell was complicated & needed to be recast every two years.

<p>Jocelyn was also convinced by Magnus into letting Clary undergo the ritual performed on Shadowhunter children to protect them from demonic forces or influence. Tessa stood in for the Iron Sister, & for the needed Silent Brother, they were able to call on Brother Zachariah. Clary & Jocelyn then took the surname "Fray"— <b>a portmanteau of Fairchild & Gray</b>, chosen as gratitude for Tessa, to honor her relationship with her ancestors.

<p>When she was around five years old, Jocelyn's best friend Luke eventually found them in New York, & Jocelyn allowed him to be a staple part of their lives. Clary grew up with Luke as a father figure to her, led to believe that her real father was a deceased soldier named Jonathan Clark, & that the box in her mother's room with the initials J.C. were his.

<p>Clary attended the mundane school St. Xavier's, close to their home in <b>Park Slope, Brooklyn</b>. When Clary was six years old & in kindergarten, she met Simon Lewis & the two grew to be inseparable. Almost every summer of her childhood, she, Jocelyn, Luke, & Simon went to Luke's farmhouse upstate. Simon slept over at their house, with Simon even sleeping on the same bed as Clary, often, & though things were purely platonic for Clary, Simon fell in love with her. Though most people around them knew, Clary remained oblivious to his feelings for her & only saw him as a best friend.

<p>Clary inherited her mother's artistic skills. At one point, she joined an art group & began taking classes at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts.

<center><h3>Jocelyn's Capture // blended canon</h3></center>
<div id="bio">
<p>Clary was unknowingly supposed to have another session with Magnus, two years after the last. Magnus had gone to Tanzania, however, so Clary went without her block for at least three weeks, & thus her Sight began to return.

<p>One evening, she dragged Simon to the Pandemonium Club, where she encountered a group of Shadowhunters & saw them kill a boy, who turned out to be an Eidolon demon. When Clary had Simon call security, no one else, not even Simon, saw the Shadowhunters, until they slipped out undetected.

<p>With Jocelyn worried about Clary's Sight & potentially running into elements of the Shadow World, she informed Clary the following morning that they were going to spend the summer at Luke's farmhouse, infuriating Clary who had her own plans, including her ongoing Tisch classes. Clary left with Simon without hearing Jocelyn's reasons. They went to Eric's poetry reading at the Java Jones, where Clary once again saw & immediately confronted Jace Wayland, one of the Shadowhunters from the night before. Jace told her of Shadowhunters & Downworlders, but before they could continue Clary finally answered Jocelyn's call. Jocelyn told her not to come home & instead to stay at Simon's & to call Luke to tell him that a particular someone had found her.

<p>Against her mother's wishes, Clary frantically rushed over to their brownstone, nervous about the panic in her mother's voice & the strange noises she heard while on the phone with Jocelyn, to find their home trashed & her mom gone. Clary was then attacked by a Ravener demon. With the Sensor she mistook for a phone & took from Jace, Clary killed it but was poisoned in the process. To protect her from demons lurking outside their house, Jace Marked her & brought her to the New York Institute to heal, as Jace, still uncertain about what Clary was, feared what the rune might do to Clary.

<p>At the Institute, Clary was introduced to its inhabitants: the other Shadowhunters that were with Jace at the Pandemonium Club, Isabelle & Alec Lightwood, & their tutor, Hodge Starkweather. Clary was told that she & one of her parents were likely Shadowhunters like them. Hodge told her a bit about Shadowhunters & informed her that she might be sent to the Silent Brothers.

<p>Clary called Luke, & after multiple failed attempts, Luke took the call & coldly turned her away. She then returned to their apartment to get her things or at least see what's left of her home, accompanied by Jace. While there, they were attacked by a Forsaken which Jace fought & killed. After the encounter, Clary then went to their downstairs neighbor Madame Dorothea to ask about the night of Jocelyn's disappearance. Dorothea, a self-proclaimed psychic, tried to 'read' Clary's mind but informed her that she likely had a block on her mind. Instead, she let Clary pick a card from her tarot deck, drawn by her mother. Clary picked out the Ace of Cups card.

<p>Clary learned that Dorothea's apartment was designated a Sancutary, & contained a Portal, which her mother could have used to flee her kidnappers the night of her disappearance; she realized that she didn't because she couldn't leave Clary behind. Clary hastily jumped into the Portal, hoping to know where Jocelyn intended to run to if she could have, & ended up outside Luke's house—which it took her to because it was the last place the Portal was used to go to as she wasn't thinking of any particular destination.

<p>Jace convinced Clary to snoop around, & they found Simon lurking outside Luke's house as well. While inside, they saw Luke arrive & be interrogated by two men, which Jace later told her were the men who killed his father. Clary was stunned to hear Luke say, seemingly firmly, that he didn't care what happened to Clary & Jocelyn & wouldn't get involved with Valentine's plans for them.

<p>When they returned to the Institute, Hodge told Clary that her mother had been a member of the Circle & was the wife of its leader, Valentine, who plotted against the Clave & was believed to have been dead for years. Hodge told her bits about her mother's past. It was decided that Clary would need to be assessed by the Silent Brothers to help her retrieve her blocked memories. At the Silent City, they learned Clary's memories of the Shadow World were being filtered & blocked from her mind. She saw the name of Magnus Bane, as a form of a signature on the spell on her mind left by the High Warlock of Brooklyn.

<p>The Shadowhunters, along with Simon, proceeded to Magnus's home to ask him about the block on her mind. Though he initially denied responsibility, Magnus was forced to acknowledge it because of his signature. He then told them the true nature of the spell & that it was upon the request of Jocelyn. He told her that he would be unable to remove the block but that its effects were already fading & would be gone completely soon enough, but that her memories may gradually or may not come back to her.

<p>On her birthday, Jace gave Clary her first witchlight, & the pair shared their first kiss in the Institute's greenhouse. They were unable to pursue a relationship due to their other friendships, particularly with Simon recently admitting his feelings for her, as well as Jace's parabatai Alec's disapproval of them.

<p>Eventually, they discovered that Valentine was after the Mortal Cup, which Jocelyn hid when she ran away from the Shadow World. When Clary discovered that she could hide physical objects in drawings, she realized that her mother may have done the same with the cup. Remembering the Ace of Cups card in the tarot deck Jocelyn made for Madame Dorothea, the group paid the charlatan a visit. Although they retrieved the Cup, Dorothea was possessed by Abbadon & battled the group, gravely injuring Alec, who was later saved by the warlock they met earlier, Magnus Bane.

<p>To their surprise, Hodge, desperate to break his curse, betrayed them by summoning Valentine to the Institute & giving him the Cup & Jace. Luke defended her when he threatened to kill her. Luke revealed himself to be a werewolf, & former Shadowhunter Lucian Graymark. He had been turning her away to protect her from the Circle members tailing him. Luke took leadership of the local lycanthrope pack to help look after Clary & search for her mother. With his pack, head over to Renwick's to rescue Jace & Jocelyn. During the confrontation, Valentine revealed that Jace was in fact his & Jocelyn's first child, Jonathan. Jace confirmed this as it was actually Valentine that raised him & made him believe that they were the Waylands. In the confusion, Valentine escaped through the ruin's Portal, taking the Cup with him. Clary managed to convince Jace, who wanted to go after Valentine, to turn his back on their father.

<p>Fortunately, they were able to keep Jocelyn, albeit in her comatose state. Jocelyn was confined to Beth Israel Hospital, where Catarina Loss worked. Clary & Luke visited her every day.

<div id="bio">
<p>Now led to believe that they were siblings, Clary & Jace distanced themselves from one another. Clary began seeing Simon, who finally managed to tell her how he felt. However, Clary & Jace evidently still harbored feelings for each other, despite the recent revelation.

<p>Luke called Clary when Jace, who'd been kicked out of the Institute by Maryse Lightwood, picked a fight with werewolves at the Hunter's Moon. The three of them went to the Institute & confronted Maryse, who said that she sent him away to spare him from the wrath of the Inquisitor Imogen Herondale who was on her way to the Institute & was coming for Jace. The Inquisitor had Jace imprisoned at the Silent City for insubordination. When the Institute received a distress call from the Silent City some time after, Clary, Isabelle, & Alec responded & found a massacre—many of the Silent Brothers were killed & the Mortal Sword was taken by Valentine, but Jace was spared. The Inquisitor allowed Jace to stay with Magnus for his recovery.

<p>Clary, Jace, Isabelle, & Simon were invited to the Seelie Court by the Queen where the woman played a trick on them. Clary unknowingly ate faerie food, rendering her trapped in the court unless released by the queen. The Queen demanded that Clary have the kiss she most desired: with Jace. Though she didn't want to hurt Simon, she had no choice but to kiss Jace, which turned passionate very quickly. After getting out, Simon stormed off.

<p>Shortly after, Raphael appeared to them outside the Institute with an almost dead Simon, informing them that Simon would rise from the dead as a vampire, unless they decided to interfere & killed him. Clary refused to let Jace kill Simon, & so they buried his dead body & allowed Simon to be reborn as a vampire.

<p>After Simon's transformation, Clary came to the hospital, where Jocelyn was, in a search of comfort. There she met Luke, whilst telling her unconscious mom all that had happened. He dropped her home & drove away, & there was Simon waiting for her, sitting on the porch. Later, Luke came back with, injured by a demon attack, Maia Roberts. Simon & Clary called Jace, & eventually, he came by with Alec & Mangus to help & heal the werewolf girl. Magnus stayed the night to heal Luke & Maia, & Jace did not have any other choice as he had to be where Magnus was.

<p>Simon & Maia were kidnapped by Valentine for a ritual, as he needed the blood of a werewolf & a vampire. Alec & Isabelle stayed to warn the Clave, & Clary & Jace went on a rescuing mission with Luke & Magnus. At the river, Clary drew the Fearless rune on Jace. While making their way to Valentine's boat with Luke & Magnus, she was taken by a Demon on the boat. Clary inscribed an Open rune (the one she used on Jace's cell) on the boat which made it fall apart. At the end as they made their escape it was already sunrise, & they learned that Simon was then able to walk in the sunlight (because of the angel blood in Jace's blood).

<center><h3>Mortal War // blended canon</h3></center>
<div id="bio">
<p>Madeleine Bellefleur showed up to Clary & told her that her mother can be woken up from her "coma" by a warlock named Ragnor Fell, who lived in Idris. Apparently, the coma was self-induced by a potion from <b>the Book of the White</b>. Clary planned to leave with the members of the New York Institute. Jace called Simon, who was now a Daylighter, to lie & say that Clary cannot come. During their chat, they were attacked by Forsaken & forced to go into the Portal without Clary, but with Simon.

<p>Clary later arrived at the institute & was told by Magnus Bane what happened (leaving out Simon) & that she could no longer go to Idris. Upset, Clary walked off to the side of the institute, where a rune to make a portal popped up in her head. She drew it on the wall & went to Idris, taking Luke with her. They ended up in Lake Lyn, where Clary got sick, as the lake, ever since the angel Raziel was raised in it, was poisonous to Nephilim. Luke then took her to his sister's house, Amatis, where Clary was cured.

<p>When she woke up, she found out that Luke left, because Downworlders aren't allowed in Idris without special permission. Clary then went, disobeying Amatis, to the Penhallow's house, where the Lightwoods were staying. When she knocked on the door, Isabelle opened it & was very surprised. Clary came in, demanding to see Jace, & saw Alec, Max Lightwood, & Sebastian Verlac. They were all equally surprised & tell Clary that Jace was upstairs. Clary walked in & found Jace kissing Aline Penhallow. Jace then screamed at Clary, telling her that she is reckless & never think about her actions.

<p>Clary ran out & Sebastian followed. He walked her to Amatis' house. She told him she was looking for Ragnor Fell & Sebastian said he would help her out. The next day, Clary was woken up by rocks being thrown at her window by Sebastian. She then went with him, on a horse, to Ragnor Fell's house. When they arrived, Clary found Magnus Bane at the house, who froze Sebastian. He told her that Ragnor was dead & that he didn't trust Sebastian. He also said that the Book of White was hidden in the Wayland manor. Magnus then unfroze Sebastian & pretended to be upset & told them nothing.

<p>They left & Sebastian took Clary to the Fairchild manor ruins, where her family had lived. Sebastian then kissed Clary, who decided that it felt wrong & broke away. Sebastian got mad at her all of a sudden, before calming down & telling her that he was sorry. He then revealed that Simon is in prison in the Gard. Sebastian then took Clary back to Amatis' house, where she found Jace. Upset, Clary started throwing plates at him. He calmed her down, & then they used a portal to get to the Wayland manor, to find the Book of White, which Jace, having lived there for ten years, knew just where to find it.

<p>Jocelyn had hidden it in 'Simple Recipes for Housewives', a book she knew that her husband would never open. They discovered the remains of an experiment Valentine had been running on a half-dead angel, called Ithuriel. They then learned through the angel that Jace had demon blood. Jace, after the angel showed them the visions, pulled out a dagger & handed it to the angel. The angel killed himself. The two barely made it out of the house alive when it began to explode & while lying on the ground they shared a brief moment of passionate romance. Clary stopped the two of them when things began to go too far, accusing Jace of using her so he could hate himself when he said he blamed his demon blood for his incestuous feelings for her. The two returned to Alicante & find it in flames. Clary gave the spellbook to Magnus so he could wake up her mother.

<p>Jace, Clary, & Alec left to break Simon out of jail where Simon was kept & broke both him & Samuel, Simon's roommate, out, only to discover that Samuel was actually Hodge Starkweather. He informed them that the mirror, the last of the Mortal Instruments, was actually the Lake Lyn. Hodge was then killed by Sebastian, who claimed that he did it to keep them out of danger. This caused the four to realize that Sebastian was a spy for Valentine, who fled after a difficult battle with them. They returned to the Hall, only to discover that Sebastian had killed Max. After Max's funeral, Jace sneaked into Clary's bedroom & told her he loved her & always will. The two then fell asleep holding hands. The following morning, Jace left a note behind & sneaked off to find Sebastian.

<p>Clary managed to convince the Clave to fight with the Downworlders & taught them a binding rune that the dying angel showed her. It was during this time that she discovered after talking with her mother, who had finally awaken from her coma by Magnus through the spell book, that she had received angel’s blood while in the womb & that Jace was actually the son of Stephen Herondale, son of the last Inquisitor, who had also received angel's blood during his own experiment while he was in his mother's womb. That meant that Jace & Clary were not siblings, & further revealed that Sebastian was actually Clary's brother.

<p>Clary then marked Simon with the Mark of Cain, a powerful protection spell, with the intent of saving him from Raphael, who said that vampires will only fight with Shadowhunters against Valentine if they gave him Simon. The exchange caused the vampires to fight with the Clave. Clary portaled to Lake Lyn to stop Valentine from summoning Raziel, but he used runes to paralyze her body & voice. He then revealed to her his intent of using her as a sacrifice. When Jace arrived to rescue her Valentine used Jace's blood for the sacrifice by stabbing him in the chest, & successfully summoned Raziel. However, Clary managed to put her own mark on the pentagram, which made her the one summoning the angel. Raziel was able to bring Valentine to justice & killed him. When Raziel offered to grant Clary one wish, Clary asked for Jace. Once he was brought back, the town celebrated their victory over Valentine's army. During the celebration, The Seelie Queen asked Clary for a favor but she turned the Queen down stating she had everything she wanted.

<center><h3>Sebastian's Resurrection // blended canon</h3></center>
<div id="bio">
<p>Jace had been having dreams in which he murdered Clary by stabbing her or choking her which had led to stress between the two of them, leading Jace to avoid her. This, of course, led Clary to worry what was going on between them. Clary & her mother also discovered that someone was trying to make more children like Jonathan, which again Jocelyn had trouble coming to terms with.

<p>Clary then went to the Church of Talto only to find herself fighting a Hydra demon & was later helped out by Isabelle. Jace & Clary had an intimate moment in one of the spare rooms in the Institute. At the moment of taking a further step in their relationship, Jace injured Clary with a knife. Disturbed by his recent nightmares, Jace broke down & admitted that he'd been having nightmares & that was the reason why he was avoiding Clary. Clary then offered to take him to the Silent City to get help from the Silent Brothers. There, the Silent Brothers said that the nightmares Jace was having was due to his vulnerability to demonic influence, which occurred after Jace was resurrected by the Angel Raziel. All Shadowhunters are subject to a ritual to protect them as infants. As Jace died, it was like he had been reborn without the protection. The Brothers wanted to perform the ritual again to give him the protection performed. Clary wanted to stay with Jace, but the Silent Brothers said that she would be a distraction. Jace told Clary that he would get better for her & Clary promised to see him very soon. Clary & Jace said their goodbyes & Clary left for the night.

<p>Jocelyn & Luke, now engaged, attended an engagement party organized by Luke's werewolf pack, in which Simon disappeared. Clary also disappeared after being secretly kidnapped by Jace, who was under Lilith's influence, & what no one else knew about yet. He had lied to Clary about leaving the Silent Brothers early. Jace told her about a rune that binds them to one another forever. Clary accepted & handed him her stele. He began to draw a rune, but Clary realized too late that this was not the rune he told her about as she began to lose consciousness with Jace catching her & carrying her away. Jace brought Clary to Lilith & Lilith ordered him to kill her if Simon did not resurrect Sebastian.

<p>Clary tricked Jace by saying she did not wish to watch & he embraced her. She then grabbed Jace's knife & cut the rune that Lilith was using to possess him on his chest, causing Jace to be freed from Lilith's control. Jace told Clary to run away, & believed that she did, but then Lilith revealed that Clary stayed & started torturing her with a whip. The third time that she went to hit Clary, Simon killed Lilith by throwing himself between Lilith & Clary (Mark of Cain). Clary was severely injured. Later, Alec gave his stele to Jace to help heal Clary's wounds.

<p>Left alone up on the roof, while the Clave took note of what had happened, Jace & Clary shared an intimate moment. Jace was ashamed of his actions despite literally having no control over himself. Clary told him that she loves him no matter what happens & the two shared a kiss. She then went down to the lobby to meet her mother, Luke, Simon, Maia, Alec, Magnus, & Isabelle, promising to come back in five minutes. However, she did not know that Jace would not be there when she would come back, & then resurrected Sebastian had taken Jace with him.

<p>Following Sebastian's resurrection & his disappearance with Jace, the Clave used the Mortal Sword to drag any kind of information they could from Clary. Two weeks after, the Clave de-prioritized the search for the two, & she was cleared from any wrongdoing. Desperate, Clary, Alec, Isabelle, & Simon went to the Seelie Queen for help. For information about Jace, the Seelie Queen requested two faerie rings kept in the New York Institute.

<p>Clary secretly decided to steal the rings without telling the others, aside from Simon. While searching for the rings in the library, she caught a glimpse of Jace & Sebastian briefly appearing in the library & noticed that they were friendly with each other, which she later relayed to the others.

<p>That night Clary woke to find Jace lying in bed with her, asking her to come with him. Shortly after this, Sebastian entered the room - which was discovered by Jocelyn, who screamed & alerted Luke. Just before the two left, Sebastian managed to stab Luke with a silver dagger, but they promised to return for Clary. Clary & her mother, Jocelyn, decided to stay over at Magnus' apartment & soon, Alec, Simon & Isabelle were staying at the apartment too.

<p>She eventually decided to join the two men as a spy while using the Faerie rings to communicate with Simon. During the time spend in Sebastian's hideaway Clary realized that Jace has been possessed by Sebastian, as he acts more like Sebastian than himself. While boys were away, Clary had an opportunity to search Sebastian's room, where she discovered her lost faerie ring. She managed to alert Simon of most of Sebastian's plan & told him to come to the Seventh Sacred Site, but was caught midway through by Sebastian & was forced to destroy the Faerie ring. The two then fought & Sebastian unsuccessfully tried to rape Clary, who managed to escape. She ended up going to the Seventh Site, where Simon gave Clary Raziel's sword, which she used to hunt Sebastian. Unable to reach Sebastian, Clary used the Angel blade to stab Jace, believing that it wouldn't kill him as his heart was more good than evil. Jace was set alight, leading the others to believe that he was dead. However, his heart was still beating & he was taken into the Institute to be cured by Brother Zachariah.

<p>When she was finally allowed to visit Jace, she learned that stabbing him with Glorious had filled him with "sacred fire", which would burn anything he touched whenever Jace got an adrenaline rush.

<center><h3>The Dark War // blended canon</h3></center>
<div id="bio">
<p>During the weeks following the battle against Sebastian, the group saw that the Clave was trying to ignore the threat that Sebastian & his Endarkened army posed.

<p>While Christmas shopping with Simon, during which she told him to make his relationship with Isabelle official, Jocelyn & Luke came to pick her up for an emergency meeting at the Institute. There, they were told that Sebastian attacked several Institutes, turning its residents into Endarkened, & all Shadowhunters were being asked to evacuate to Idris.

<p>Once in Idris, they stayed at Amatis's house. While looking through Amatis' clothes, she found a white mourning jacket which Jocelyn encouraged her to wear to the Clave meeting the next morning, as a show of solidarity to all of the Nephilim whose family members were killed or Turned in the Institute attacks.

<p>She awoke in the middle of the night & got up for a glass of water, only to stop in the hallway when she heard Jocelyn & Luke's whispered voices. She eavesdropped as Jocelyn explained to Luke that she found something in the cupboard, something she hadn't seen since Valentine stole all of their belongings. Jocelyn admitted she assumed it had been blown up in the explosion in Valentine's old apartment, & after Clary listened a little longer, she eventually realized that Jocelyn was talking about the box with photos of Sebastian, which she took out & cried over every year on his birthday.

<p>Clary met up with Jace before the meeting. She informed Jace about what she overheard, & Jace replied that he thought Sebastian left the box as a message to the Clave & to Jocelyn & Clary that even the wards couldn't keep him out.

<p>At the Clave meeting, two very young Shadowhunters, Julian Blackthorn & Emma Carstairs, were harshly interrogated regarding the attack on Los Angeles Institute. When Emma ran off, Clary felt bad for her & approached her to try & give her some comfort & advice. Emma quickly warmed up to her. When Jace arrived to tell them that the meeting was over, Emma gushed over Jace. Before they parted ways, she promised Emma that she could come talk to her or Jace anytime she needed & told her where they were staying.

<p>In Alicante, Jace & Clary took a nighttime walk around the city. The two ultimately ended up in an alley, where, despite Jace's hesitation, Clary kissed him. Their kissing escalated so quickly that Jace lost control over the heavenly fire, which caused him to burn his hand prints into the brick wall he was leaning against. He became so panicked & fearful that he hurt Clary that he quickly pulled away.

<p>The next day, Jace & Clary went to Diana Wrayburn's shop to look for a new sword for Clary. Diana offered a shortsword to Clary for free, which was eventually revealed to be Heosphoros, one of the two Morgenstern swords made by Wayland the Smith. She insisted that Clary should not let the sword have power over her because of its previous owner, & told her to use it to kill her brother & take back the honor of her family's name.

<p>Just when Clary blessed Heosphoros in the Accords Hall fountain, the demon towers lit up to signal a battle was coming, & Jace with Clary raced to the Gard. There they found Robert Lightwood & Jia Penhallow sending Shadowhunters, some inexperienced & ill-equipped, to fight the Endarkened at the Adamant Citadel. Despite being ordered not to, they both escaped through the Portal to face Sebastian. At the battle, Sebastian stabbed Jace, & jerked back as he was burned by heavenly fire. Sebastian's forces disappeared into the ground, & Clary rushed to help Jace. Clary marked Jace with an iratze, she created using her skills to the fullest. It was powerful enough to somehow heal him.

<p>Later they discovered that Sebastian had taken hostage of Downworlders' leaders: Raphael, Luke, Meliorn & Magnus, along with Jocelyn. He demanded Clary & Jace in return, & the Clave were given two days to come up with a decision. Secretly, Clary, Jace, Alec, Isabelle & Simon traveled to the other dimension, Edom.

<p>Upon their arrival at Edom, they were separated by a demon that showed them their dreams. In Clary's, she was living in Idris happily, with Jocelyn & Luke—who were married & had a daughter, Valentina—named after her late father Valentine who was considered a hero—and with her brother, Jonathan, who was not born with demon blood. In the illusion, it was Clary & Jace's wedding day. Clary was snapped out of the illusion when he asked Jonathan about Simon & was absent in the dream.

<p>While resting in a cave in the realm, Jace was overwhelmed with the heavenly fire. Clary was revisited by a dream & a vision of the first rune she'd ever received a vision of. When she came to help Jace, who was by then engulfed by the fire, she used the rune on Heosphoros & trapped the heavenly fire with it.

<p>Later, when Isabelle was recuperating from a demonic wound during a run-in with demons, Clary & Jace bathed and, now free of the threat of unleashing Jace's heavenly fire, had sex for the first time by the cave's pool.

<p>When the time came to advance on the dimension's Gard—Sebastian's base & where he was keeping his hostages — Clary pretended that she wanted to unite with her brother. Once she got close, she stabbed him with Heospheros, & thus he was struck with the heavenly fire she'd trapped in it. The heavenly fire burned away the evil in him — the demon blood that made him who he was — & Jonathan apologized for his sins & bid her & Jocelyn farewell.

<p>To get out of Edom, they had to sacrifice Simon's immortality & memories of Shadow World & his friends. The Clave burned Sebastian's body at Clary's request, & she & Jace scattered his ashes, which were kept in his silver box (the one that Jocelyn had), at Lake Lyn.

<p>In New York, Clary attempted to approach the amnesiac Simon but was too heartbroken when she realized that Simon truly no longer recognized her. After she left, Isabelle & Magnus realized that bits of Simon's memories manifested in different ways and, after Magnus gave him back what he could, took him to Jocelyn & Luke's wedding & reunited him with Clary.

<h4>why a schedule</h4>
<br />
<p>After mantaining (or trying to maintain) various blog on this blue hellsite for far too long, I've come to realize that the only way I can evenly distribute activity between all of my blogs, as well as keep myself from becoming too overwhelmed by some of them, is by implementing a schedule. this schedule is <b>set but flexible</b>. you can find it outlined on the following tab. 

<p>generally speaking, on the day listed, that blog will have <b>priority</b>. I'll login there first, tackle whatever tracked threads, drafts, or inbox thngs are there, then I'm free to meander through the dash as I like. if there isn't much to do on that blog, I'll scoot over to another who might be a little behind, or who has extra projects. or I may just pop over wherever I'm feeling. 

<p>this doesn't mean that that day is the only day I'll be on the blog! it just means that on that day, there's <b>a specific starting point</b> before I wander elsewhere. it keeps me accountable ;)

<p><b>option i.</b> meeting after she joins the institute.
<blockquote>
    <p>as a memeber of the institute of new york, Clary can often be found training there or running missions with Jace, Izzy, & Alec.
</blockquote>

<p><b>option ii.</b> meeting in Alicante.
<blockquote>
    <p>infrequently, she has to travel to the Shadowhunter homeworld to settle business so it's possible to cross paths with her there during one such trip.
</blockquote>

<p><b>option iii.</b> meeting during her mundane life.
<blockquote>
    <p>unlike other shadowhunters, Clary was held back from her Nephilim heritage until she was 16 so there's always the possibility of her having crossed pathswith someone in her previous life.

<h4>headcanons</h4>

<p>- Clary is often said to look almost exactly like Jocelyn with their green eyes, curly red hair, slender figure, small chest & narrow hips, though she does not see it, nor does she see the beauty others often see in her. 

<p>- When she was younger, she gravitated towards more boyish clothes - baggy t-shirts, jeans, & sneakers being the primary parts of her wardrobe but as she grew older & spent more time around Isabelle, she's embraced the more feminine side of herself.

<p>- Clary has a white star-shaped scar on her shoulder because of her contact with the angel Ithuriel. She received her scar because she was born with Ithuriel's angel blood in her veins through Valentine's experiments.

<p>- Clary now goes by her mother's maiden name, <b>Fairchild</b>.

<p>- She cuts her own hair.

<p>For her mother and Luke's wedding, she painted a portrait of Luke & Jocelyn as a wedding gift.

<p>Though Shadowhunters do not celebrate Thanksgiving, Clary & Simon, having grown up mundane, missed it & started throwing their own Thanksgiving parties with their new friends & family. They've enjoyed introducing Jace, Izzy, Alec, & the others to such delicacies as green bean casserole & sweet potatoes with melted marshmallows.

<p>In 2010, Clary's soul attended the wedding of Tessa Gray & Jem Carstairs on Blackfriars Bridge in her dreams. It soon faded from her memory.

<h4>description</h4>
<p>After valentine was killed* during the uprising, Jocelyn, pregnant with Clary, took her growing family & left idris for paris. She would live there quietly for a number of years before it became apparent that simple discipline alone was not enough to curb the effects of the demon blood running in Jonathan's veins.

<p>When he was six, she realized she wouldn't be able to give him what he needed alone, & left paris to find old friends & allies. weeks later, the family <b>presented themselves to the lightwoods</b> at the new york institute, asking not only for shelter but for training for the boy, as well as eventually for his younger sister. the training was intense, but the two young fairchild children flourished within the confines of the Clave's outpost.

<h4>description</h4>
<p>She dove into the heart of darkness to save him, playing a dangerous game against the psychopath that wore the face of her brother <b>utterly alone</b> in the hopes she could last just long enough for them to find a solution, but the angels <b>aren't merciful</b>. even with Glorious, facing off against Sebastian <i>&</i> Lilith proved to be too much. Still, facing an army of <b>endarkened</b>, Clary knew she had to make a choice. 

<p>After Lilith cast <b>glorious</b> into Hell, Clary used the last window open to her & cut her brother down in a fit of desperation - not with a blade of heavenly fire, but with a fatal blow to the heart. Doing this killed her brother, but it also destroyed one of the most integral pieces of her own soul; in one move, not only had she cut down their greatest enemy, but also the soulmate that had been tied to him. Her soulmate. Her <i>once, fiercely</i>. 

<p>She doesn't remember the battle after that, only that it was fierce, & brief. They lost heavy numbers that day but nothing compared to the gaping hole in her heart. After the dust settled & the dead taken to their final resting places, she was the one to take Jace to the Silent City. Unbeknownst to all, before allowing him his due right to be cremated & his ashes & bones to rest in the Silent City, she tried one last time to bring a piece of him back. The rune came to her like all the others had, but it didn't work - the boy she had loved with everything she had was <b>gone</b>.

<p>She didn't speak for a year after, throwing herself into more & more intense training. When the <b>Scholomance</b> reopened during the Cold Peace, & having nothing to lose, Clary threw herself even further into training. She remained at the Institute of New York after completing her training as a Centurion, tied to the the spot & unable to move on. 

<br><br><Br>

<h4>interaction ideas</h4>
<p><b>option i</b>. meeting in a public place in New York City. 
<blockquote>
    <p>while Clary no longer wanders the city as freely as she used to, she does sometimes re-visit old haunts & places that hold deep meaning to her. The streets of Brooklyn she & Simon would have explored, the building that housed Java Jones - regardless if it’s still there or not. She sometimes wanders Central Park at night since mundanes can’t see her.
</blockquote>

<p><b>option ii</b>. meeting in a public place in London. 
<blockquote>
    <p>as a Centurion, but also as one of the most famous ( or if you ask her, infamous ) shadowhunters in living memory, Clary spends a lot of time in London because it’s close enough to home without the weight of the memories of home. while working at the London Institute, she can be found wandering the city, the shadow market, & grabbing coffee out & about.
</blockquote>

<p><b>option iii</b>. meeting at an institute for official Clave business. 
<blockquote>
    <p>as a Centurion, & most definitely because of her unique abilities, Clary is in high demand for things that strike just a shade above normal bumps in the night. the institutes she gets called to the most are London & Los Angeles, but occasionally she also gets called back to New York. any & all Institutes are fair game if there’s a greater demon on the loose.
</blockquote>

<p><b>option iv</b>. meeting at the Scholomance. 
<blockquote>
    <p>after the battle of the Burren, Clary spent time at the Scholomance training & preparing to become a Centurion. she would have studied alongside several familiar faces, or would have just left when several were starting, so this is an option open on a <b>plotting intensive basis</b>.
</blockquote>

<p><b> option v</b>. meeting in the spiral labyrinth. 
<blockquote>
    <p>as a Centurion, Clary has access to the labyrinth, & often goes there for research purposes, but mostly to escape. this option is open to warlocks & other centurions on a <b>plotting intensive basis</b>.
</blockquote>

<h4>headcanons</h4>
<p>- my interpretation of the <b>scholomance & centurions</b> comes largely from personal headcanon & the wiki for the time being.

<p>- the centurions have a medallion or pin that signifies their status; the pin has a pattern of a leafless stick and the words primi ordines on it. they also have their family crests on the back of their gear. 

<p>- her status as a centurion means she has access to the libraries of the spiral labyrinth & the silent brothers' archives.
    
<p>- she has several runes unique to her as a Centurion, given her connection to Ithuriel: a nameless combination rune across her right peck, over her heart, that invokes the phrases <b>AVE ATQUE VALE</b> (hail & farewell) & <b>PULVIS ET UMBRA SUMUS</b> (we are dust and shadows) - the traditional words said over the dead. this rune signifies her status as a <b>CENTURION</b>, acknowledging that she will die alone with no one to say the words over her body, & that she has already accepted death while still living.
    
<p>- in this verse, she has & carries both <b>Phaesphoros</b> & <b>Heosphoros</b>.
    
<p>- she did <b>not</b> destroy the apartment.
    
<p>- additionally, she did <b>not</b> attend Luke & Jocelyn's wedding, nor did she attend Isabelle & Simon's. She has isolated herself away from everyone in the wake of killing Jace. 
    
<p>- The rune she drew on Jace <i>did</i> work, just not in the way she thought. Instead of bringing Jace back, it tied their souls together, enabling her to absorb some of the same abilities he had possessed to to his own connection to Ithuriel. This is what enabled her to advance so rapidly in training after his death, even if she doesn't know it.

<h4>description</h4>

<p>It wasn't an alliance anyone saw coming. Valentine wasn't dead - Jocelyn believed this deep in her bones, even after having seen the smoldering remains of the Fairchild mansion. He had prepared for this <i>too well</i>, & Jocelyn knew it was only a matter of time before he found her again. After fleeing Idris, Jocelyn fled first to Paris, & then to New York. Nowhere she went seemed far enough away, & when Clary was six, Jocelyn took her to Magnus Bane in the hopes that he could somehow close her inner eye to the Shadow World. Magnus had another idea, entirely.

<p>An old friend visiting the warlock happened to overhear the exchange, & offered an alternate - less damaging - solution. Nephilim blood was distateful to vampires, after all, & she could smell the elevated levels in the girl. Sonja offered to take her, & raise her far away from anywhere Valentine would even think to look for her. The vampire clan wasn't especially friendly to the likes of him - especially not a clan lead by a <b>FORMER NEPHILIM</b>. 

<p>Jocelyn agreed - anything to keep her daughter out of the hands of the man who had defiled her son & killed her own parents - & Clary was taken to <b>Ördögház</b> to be raised among the clan. There, she would train among the vampires & their special forces - the Death Dealers - so that one day she could re0enter the shadow world & stand a fighty chance.

<p><b>option i.</b> meeting during her time in the coven
<blockquote>
    <p>Clary stays with the coven for ten years - from six until sixteen - & the bulk of her training takes place here. She has access to the coven's grounds, but also can travel <b>somewhat</b> extensively given the Coven's funds so meeting somewhere in Eastern Europe is a definite possibility. 
</blockquote>
 
<p><b>option ii.</b> meeting after moving to NYC.
 <blockquote>
     <p>After Clary turns 16, she's revealed to the Clave & there's a custody hearing. Eventually, she's granted her freedom to move between Idris, New York, & Ördögház as needed so it's possible for her to meet anyone at sixteen once she's moved to the Institute of New York.
 </blockquote>
 
<p><b>option iii.</b> meeting originally as children
 <blockquote>
     <p>Clary lived in New York until she was six years old, & as such, she would only barely remember anyone she met during that time but the possibility exists - especially if she were to meet them again after having lived with the Coven for some time.

<blockquote>
    <p>because of this training, she has a high proficiency for firearms even though they aren't Clave-sanctioned & do not typically work on demons.
</blockquote>

<p>- because of her unusually potent angelic blood, Clary's blood is <b>unappealing</b> to vampires - meaning one would have to be unusually desperate to be enticed by it. this is how she's been able to survive safely in the coven even when others are only minimally supervised by Sonja's most trusted coven members. 

<p>- As an added layer of protection, Jocelyn doesn't know the official location of the Old World Coven. Clary has been raised in <b>Ördögház, Hungary</b>, since she was a child. It's a city near the Hungarian city of Szentendre, between Budapest & the Pilis-Visegrád Mountains.

<p>- she can speak English, Hungarian, German, & Romanian.

<p><blockquote><b>important!</b> this verse is based as an extension of her <b>centurion</b> verse, found under her canon variants tab. all headcanons & notes prior to 2013 will carry over.</blockquote>

<p>After falling through a rift in space & time due to the <b>convergence</b> in 2013, Clary found herself in another New York so very unlike the world she had left behind. <b>Earth-199999</b>. 

<p>After wandering for what felt like a long time, cut off from the Shadoworld that no longer seemed to exist, she found herself swept up by <b>SHIELD</b>. Her unique abilities gave her a fighting edge, & she was recruited to work alongside other agents, as well as eventually working alongside the Avengers themselves.

<p>Because the Convergence only happens once every 5,000 years, it would seem it impossible for her to return home. It's a new world, & a new chance for change. She had wanted to leave behind a world that took almost everything from her, & so now she embraces this new timeline & hopes that maybe this time she can protect the things that matter to her the most.

<h4>headcanons</h4>
<p>- Clary has a unique set of abilities gained from her <b>nephilim blood</b>, which is further enhanced because of her connection to the angel <b>ithuriel</b>. She can draw <a href="https://shadowhunters.fandom.com/wiki/Runes">runes on her skin</a>, & those runes give her special abilities dependent on what she draws. She's the only one of her people who can create new runes. 

<p>- Because of her ambiguously human status, she works for <b>SHIELD</b> as a top level agent but largely assists <b>STRIKE</b> & the Avengers. 

<p>- She does & will not use guns. Instead, she relies on the two special black adamas swords she's carried with her since before falling through to this timeline. 

<p>- in this verse, she lives in a row house in Manhttan that, in her home timeline, had been <a href="https://shadowhunters.fandom.com/wiki/Garroway_Books">Garroway Books</a>, a bookstore owned by her step-father, Luke Garroway. It was purchased for her by the engineerings of her lawyer, Darcy Lewis (<a href="http://darcywho.tumblr.com/">@darcywho</a>).

<h1>carried over from her centurion verse</h1>

<blockquote>

<p>- the centurions have a medallion or pin that signifies their status; the pin has a pattern of a leafless stick and the words primi ordines on it. they also have their family crests on the back of their gear. 
    
<p>- she has several runes unique to her as a Centurion, given her connection to Ithuriel: a nameless combination rune across her right peck, over her heart, that invokes the phrases <b>AVE ATQUE VALE</b> (hail & farewell) & <b>PULVIS ET UMBRA SUMUS</b> (we are dust and shadows) - the traditional words said over the dead. this rune signifies her status as a <b>CENTURION</b>, acknowledging that she will die alone with no one to say the words over her body, & that she has already accepted death while still living.
    
<p>- in this verse, she has & carries both <b>Phaesphoros</b> & <b>Heosphoros</b>. 
    <blockquote>
        <p><b>heosphoros:</b> the length of a forearm - half the size of Phaesphoros. Made of black gold & adamas. The cross-guard, grip, & pommel are gold with obsidian, & the blade is a silver so dark that it looks nearly black. On the other side of the blade, along the center ridge, is a pattern of black stars, symbolizing the Morgensterns. Kept in a dark leather scabbard with a pattern of silver stars sewn through it
        
        <p><b>phaesphoros:</b> Of the same design as its sister blade, but nearly twice the size.

<h4>description</h4>
<p>Unlike many students at Hogwarts, Clary was plucked from her mundane middle school in sixth grade, having spent much of her childhood largely ensconced in the quiet but creative life her mother had carved for her & her brother in a flat in Brooklyn after fleeing her abusive marriage. She has no memory of her father, & had Jocelyn had it her way, they would have remained normal children growing up safe & unattached to the world their father & his followers had corrupted for her.

<p>Unfortunately, it wouldn’t last; Clary was nine years old when her older brother, Jonathan, received a strange letter in the mail, stamped with a wax crest, & written in glittering ink. The next thing she knew, she was hand in hand with her mother, brother scowling on the other side, as Jocelyn took the wand she had hidden for eleven years & accompanied her son to Diagon Alley for the list of things he would need to start school. 

<p>It was there, tucked away in a small corner in the back of Flourish & Blotts, that both children found books that would go on to influence their school career for years to come. For Clary, it was a hand-illustrated copy of Winogrand's Wondrous Water Plants<sup>1</sup>. The pictures inspired her own art, & she began studying & drawing these new, fantastic plants even before she started her own first year at Hogwarts two years later.

<p>Over the next few years, she’d continue to read up on the world she had become aware of even while attending school in the muggle world. She excelled at art, often using her whimsical drawings inspired by herbology textbooks for school illustrations. She also found science fascinating, gravitating to biology & botany on a small scale during labs. It was during this time she also discovered Beatrix Potter & her own work as a scientific illustrator<sup>2</sup>.

<p>It was also during this time, however, that Valentine reappeared, kidnapping Jonathan while he was in transit between the school & their home over Christmas break. Clary would remember that as the defining moment that changed her brother, turning him into someone far more quiet, & determined, than he had been before.

<p>When she turned 11, her own letter came & she accompanied Jocelyn to Diagon Alley alongside her brother, only this time she was the one to come home with a wand, a cauldron, & a Tawny Owl of her own that she named Beatrix<sup>3</sup>. She was later sorted into Gryffindor, hardly a surprise given it was her mother’s house, & putting her slightly & humorously in contrast to her brother, who had been placed in Slytherin five years earlier. 

<p>Like her earlier muggle schooling, Clary was surprised to discover much of it had carried over - she excelled at herbology, as well as charm work. While Potions didn’t quite come naturally to her, her brother’s tutelage helped immensely & she developed an affinity for them in her own way. 

<p>She would later receive OWLs that advanced her interests in Herbology & Charms, as well as various other subjects, then also received  high or at least passing grades in the following subjects for her NEWTs: Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes & Potions.  

<p><center><h3>notes</h3></center>

<p><sup>1</sup>written & illustrated in the same style as Beatrix Potters’ works

<p><sup>2</sup>had she not eventually gone to Hogwarts, Clary likely would have followed a similar career path to her inspiration & gone into scientific illustration & botany based research.

<p><sup>3</sup>named after her inspiration, naturally.

<p>- verse is compliant with my own <a href="https://affcgato.tumblr.com/">Jonathan’s</a> Hogwarts Professor verse, but can happily be alternately plotted to accommodate others’ canons.

</blockquote>

<p><b2>option ii</b2>. diagon alley.
<blockquote>
    <p>infrequently, clary makes trips to diagon alley for anything she can procure from dogweed & deathcap or grow herself in the greenhouses. she tries to schedule those trips so she can meet up with friends or family, but she always leaves a bit of free time so she can explore new shops or have some time to herself so she won't feel rushed.
</blockquote>

<p><b2>option iii</b2>. hogsmede.	
<blockquote>
    <p>clary tends to disappear to the village on weekends, helping residents with little projects & spending time helping with inventory & ordering for Dogweed and Deathcap, or meeting with friends at Three Broomsticks.
</blockquote>


<p><b2>option iv</b2>. abroad.
<blockquote>
    <p>sometimes Clary is called to other schools to teach niche herbology matters, or to help cultivate rare & delicate pieces that others struggle with. there's always a chance for her to encounter another muse while doing so!
</blockquote>

<p><b2>option v</b2>. prior to Hogwarts.
<blockquote>
    <p>Clary initially attended a muggle school in Brooklyn, prior to being sent her letter. It's definitely an option, however she's been largely removed from that world since her brother got his letter a year before her & left for Hogwarts.
option vi. hogwarts, as a student.

<h4>description</h4>

<p>Born in 8 ABY on the planet of <b>Naboo</b>, Clary planned to eventually follow in the footsteps of her grandmother, the handmaiden <b>Rabé</b>, & become prominent in the arts in her own right. With a mother who was known as a renowned artist & an infamous diathim father widely known in the political circles, it was little surprise when, at the age of twelve, she became elected to the throne of naboo. she would serve two terms, supporting Naboo from 20 ABY to 24 ABY before disappearing into the ether under mysterious circumstances after the transfer of power.

<p>you see, <b>she has a secret</b>. In the days leading up to the coronation of her successor, each of her handmaidens had quietly reached out, searching for a way to hide her before the protections afforded to her as queen were stripped away. Mere days before, they found something that could work. Hiring a smuggler to move her off planet only hours after she had completed the transfer of power & before even clearing the last of the highly stylized makeup from her face, Clary was ushered into a ship & taken to <b>dathomir</b>, where she would spend the next few years honing her gift. 

<p>It was this gift that had landed her in his father's crosshairs, after al; Clary has always had a unique gift for working with crystals - not just the ones found in veins of pure kyberite, but others as well. she can imbue them with their own unique abilities, with a little effort, but this gift comes at a significant cost: this connection to them means she’s <b>tied to them</b>, & taking her away from them for too long drains the life right out of her. 

<p>Studying the work of <b>Galen Erso</b>, Clary was able to hone her signature ability - <b>force transference</b> - under the tuteledge of <a href="https://bastxrds.tumblr.com/">yennefer of dathomir</a>. Because of this ability, she's able to draw immense amounts of energy through the Force & transfer it in to virtually anyting, but especially kybers of both natural & synthetic nature. She can do this at a rate far surpassing any other living being, but it comes at a steep cost. Separating her from her work can be lethal, so once she's set up somewhere, she can only be moved with either great care or very quick speed.  

<blockquote>
    <p>This is largely because of the symbiotic relationship between he force abilities & her crystals. Because her work has amplified her abilities, her abilities are now largely dependant on that amplification to sustain her.
</blockquote>

<p><center><i>and there's one other problem</i>. </center>

<p>she's one of the greatest assets to the resitance, but she's a double ege sword - one that could be so easily used <b>against</b> them, as well. that's why she works quietly but quickly; if the First Order gets its claws into her, it's a one way trip & there's no plan for extraction.

<p><h4>variants</h4>

<p><b>arc i</b>; <i>empress</i>.

<blockquote>
    ( <b>single ship  variant</b> with <a href="https://bastxrds.tumblr.com">@bastxrds</a>. ) in this arc, Clary became empress alongside Emperor Hux after tearing apart all of those who would have seen her tethered to a workbench for the rest of her life, making weapons for one side or another in the ongoing war. now she acts as his chief diplomat, building their empire while staying at his side as his enduring wife. 
</blockquote>

<br>

    <p><b>arc ii</b>; <i>original trilogy</i>. 
    
    <blockquote>
    coming soon, centered around the events of <b>rogue one</b>. After her tenure as handmaiden to <b>queen amidala</b> on Naboo, Clary has transitioned to her post-handmaiden life by working with <b>Galen Erso</b>, working in the field of crystallography & studying the energy potential for synthetic & natural kybers.
    
    <p><b>tag:</b> ☆ ❛ science doesn't take sides ❜ || arc ii. ( original )<br>
    <b>note:</b> this is the only arc where Clary will actively carry a lightsaber - hers is a <b>dual-phase</b> lightsaber, utilizing two different kybers she's honed in her time. she's proficient in form i, having trained at the jedi temple on coruscant as a necessity after her gifts became apparent, but she is not a jedi, nor does she have extensive formal training - merely enough for self defense. 
    
    <p>the primary kyber she utilizes is a <b>ghostfire</b> crystal, producing a nearly translucent blade that leaves an afterimage capable of distorting oppenents. the second is a <b>blackwing</b> crystal, as a callback to her time on <i>dathomir</i>. 
    
    <p>additionally, in this verse - similar to it's prequel verse - her focus has been on academic pursuit instead of manual crafting & force transference, so she's more combat inclined than she is invested in her work as a weapons engineer.
</blockquote>

<br>

    <p><b>arc iii</b>; <i>prequel trilogy</i>. 
    <blockquote>
    coming soon. serving as a handmaiden to then-<b>Queen Amidala</b>, Clary's innate diathim abilities assisted her queen in unique ways, enabling her to better protect her queen alongside the other handmaidens - something she would continue to do long after the young monarch had left Naboo to take up her role as senator in the Galactic Senate. 
    
    <p><b>tag:</b>☆ ❛ as timeless as infinity ❜ || arc iii. ( prequels )<br>

<h4>interaction ideas</h4>
<p><b>option i.</b> meeting during her younger years. 
<blockquote>
    <p>almost from birth until roughly five years before the events of The Force Awakens, Jocelyn & Clary were constantly on the move, weaving in & out of the unknown regions, as well as vaulting into wild space, all in the effort to stay one step ahead of Valentine, the cold war Imperial remnant, or anyone else who might seek to abuse Clary’s abilities for themselves.
</blockquote>
    
<p><b>option ii.</b> meeting through the Resistance. 
<blockquote>
    <p>With the public formation of the First Order in 29 ABY, it became even harder to hide in the shadows so Jocelyn turned to some of her oldest connections. The help came too late for Jocelyn, who was captured & returned to her husband’s side, but Clary was able to get away & has been with the Resistance since. 
</blockquote>
    
<p><b>option iii.</b> meeting through captivity. 
<blockquote>
    <p>Prior to the events of The Force Awakens, it’s highly probable that Clary would have fallen into the First Order’s hands, & as such would function as a very valuable hostage.

<h4>headcanons</h4>

<p>- given naboos tradition of secrecy surrounding the monarcy, she was able to detatch herself from her royal persona, ruling under the name <b2>Queen Édel</b2> from 20 ABY to 22 ABY, when she was twelve until age sixteen, when she feld the planet with her mother in the dead of night after the official transfer of power but before her father could sink his claws in.

<p>- <b>Regarding her parents</b>, <i>Jocelyn Fairchild</i> is the daughter of one of the Naboo Royal Handmaidens, & <i>Valentine Morgenstern</i> is a Diathim from Millius Prime.
            
<p>her unique genetic makeup, coupled with the environment Jocelyn was exposed to after fleeing Valentine & escaping into <b>wild space</b> while pregnant with her daughter lead to her unique abilities.
            
<p> while she's only <b>half diathim</b>, she does retain some of the abilities of her father's people - namely an unusually graceful gait that could almost be described as gliding, a resistance ( but, unlike a full Diathim, not total immunity ) to the effects of exposure to the vacuum of interplanetary space without the assistance of a protective suit or life support, & some degree of their natural hypnotic abilities that manifest namely in her ability to <b>somewhat</b> influence & de-escalate conflicting tempers before things spiral out of hand.
        
<p> Her workshop is hidden largely due to the high population of imported <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ysalamir">ysalamiri</a>, most known for their ability to repel the Force by creating a Force-neutral bubble. It's a flimsy precaution, but so far that plus the intense secrecy surrounding her location have done wonders to keep her off others' radar.          

<p><center><h3>skills & abilities</h3></center>

<p>officially, Clary is a <b>crystallographer</b> with an emphasis on energy transference & enhancement, much like Galen Erso. It was much of his research, coupled with her training under <a href="https://bastxrds.tumblr.com/">Yennefer of Dathomir</a>, that lead to her contorl & abilities that would later make her a target of the First Order & its shadow parasite, the Final Order itself. What makes her unique is she can do work at a far, far faster pace & on a greater scale without needing significant machination - something a regular human typically cannot do, but she can thanks to her Force abilities.

<p>other skills include, but aren't limited to; 

<blockquote>
    <p>some amount of ability to <b>shield her thoughts</b>
    <p>force trance - only to be used under the most dire circumstances while transporting her but with some speculation she may be capable of morichro 
    <p>perhaps most dubiously, her ability to sever force connections.
</blockquote> 

<p><b>important!</b> anything outside of her normal range of transference takes a significantly harder toll on her body & means significant time to recover.

<p><div id="exclusives"><div id="left"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hOYh8MV.png"></div> <b>Armitage Hux</b>, <a href="https://bastxrds.tumblr.com">@bastxrds</a>. She was never supposed to end up on this side of the war. After the transfer of power on Naboo, she had packed what few precious belongings she had & fled the planet for Dathomir. She was supposed to be <b>safe</b>, but eventually she had to leave the only other planet she's ever called home. After spending years hiding in Wild Space, she was picked up by First Order operatives & brought aboard the Finalizer.
<p>She never expected to fall in with the other - he was merely someone who checked her work, who kept an eye on her so that she wouldn't fall behind, but somehow the two of them developed a deeper bond as they navigated the complexities of the First Order, & when they learned of Palpatine's return, & how the First Order was to be fodder for the Sith Cultists' amibition. When the Final Order turned their guns & ships against the First Order, it was the two of them who ensured the right side walked away.
<p>Now, residing on <b>Drommund Kaas</b>, Clary sits as the trusted diplomat to the new emperor in the eyes of the public. In private, things are a little more complicated.

It's what Clary had thought wen she first laid eyes on the girl, not that much younger than her, when they had been forced to make an emergency landing on Jakku after an unofficial visit into the wilds of the Unknown Regions. Clary shouldn't have exited the shuttle, but when one of her handmaidens reported a curiously young girl, the Queen hadn't thought twice. 

<p>Bringing Rey back with them after that had been almost a given, & Clary had delayed their depature to allow the girl to collect her meager possessions before bringing her back to Naboo. Now the two are inseparable, & Clary couldn't be more glad for her very well-trained shadow.

She's had other pilots - lots of them, really. a veritable string of endless faces that have ferried her from moon to moon, from planet to planet to planet. it comes with the territory of keeping a low profile & staying off the first order's radar she she's forgotten more faces than most have met over the years. none of have them have ever let her sit up front before, though. in fact, none of them have acknowledged their all too human cargo is anything but cargo, so faced with a surely pilot who doesn't mind letting her have a view, it'sa bit of a surprise.

She always knew the First Order would find her, it was only a matter of time. Hiding away on a remote moon in the Outer Rim with only her favorite ysalamiri for company, she's enjoyed a quiet few years of living in a gilded cage but after a shady run in during a supply run, she knew her days were numbered. when they sent the best pilot to pick her up, she knew better than to fight it.
<p>what's interesting is the realization that he belongs there even less than she does, & the feelings that come with that realization.

<p><b>SSA CLARISSA FAIRCHILD</b>. after a lucrative decade of working as a high class art forger, Clary was tracked & brought in by agents of the Behavioral Analysis Unit as an added bonus while tracking a series of document forgeries she had done for <b>the circle</b>. recognizing her unique talent, she was offered a deal similar to one offered to one Penelope Garcia years prior, & now she works for the BAU as an agent & experience profiler.

<p>it wasn’t a life she had wanted for herself, but it was one her father had envisioned when he had seen her unique ability to take a work of art, see it once, & replicate it with near perfection. after years of honing that skill & having her practice for hours on end, Clary was raised to become an expert in forging not only <i>rare works of art</i>, but also <b>documents</b> & other things necessary for her father & his group - The Circle - to keep functioning. she was kept away from the other facets of the group’s operation - the trafficking of bodies, narcotics, small arms - but working in her studio until her fingers bled, she kept all of it running for several years until time ran out.

<p>she was grateful when they found her because it meant things might finally end. she’d given up on the hope of anything resembling a <b>NORMAL LIFE</b>, but finding out her father had lied to her all these years, that she had a mother, a brother, & even a nephew waiting for her out there that her father had told her were all dead is what had her accept the deal to take her skills & apply them in a way she might help rather than hurt. she finished her training in record time, & advanced through the academy like no one had seen in a good, long time, taking her place on the team amid some healthy skepticism.

<p>now she works <b>FOR THE OTHER SIDE</b>. officially she’s part of the elite art theft rapid deployment team - a group of twenty agents based in Washington D.C. each responsible for addressing art and cultural property crime cases in an assigned geographic region, but unofficially she partners with the BAU in Quantico more often than not, tracking <b>THE CIRCLE</b> so that the activities of one of the most notorious international criminal groups might finally grind to a halt.

<p>You never would have picked the fairchild children for <b>HEROES</b>. Jonathan & his twin sister Seraphina were recruited to the pan pacific defense corps. After showing considerable talent. Seraphina was recruited first, showcasing show-stopping talent, but her training stalled out when she developed a reputation of being <i>incompatible</i> in the drift with virtually everyone. Jonathan was brought in as a last resort & out of desperation, despite his erratic behavior & seeming tendency towards mental instability. These things apparently balanced out when paired with his sister, allowing the two of them to function <b>without issue</b> as rangers, even if they couldn't be paired with anyone else in the cockpit.

<p>Things seemed to be going fine until a field exploration mission to scout the areas surrounding the breach ended badly. They had been investigating the breach after abnormal data was intercepted by <b>loccent mission control</b>. When they approached the Breach, they were hit with a pulse resembling a transient electromagnetic disturbance/emp that temporarily disabled the Intercept.

<p>Accounts vary after this point - Jonathan claims something <b>CAME OUT OF THE BREACH</b> & ripped apart the Jaeger, dragging Seraphina through the Breach (& into the anteverse), but breach activity being tracked by diligent calculations by the <b>K-SCIENCE DIVISION</b> seemingly proves this would be impossible as it would mean a never before seen isolated event. instead, the PPDC officially labeled the event as a <b>large-scale equipment failure</b> & Jonathan was retired from the field due to injury, trauma, & suspected <b>pressure-induced psychosis</b>. Some went as far as to speculate he attacked his own sister & caused the damage in a psychotic episode, but that, too, cannot be proven or disproven.

<p>What is confirmed is that Jonathan was taken out of the field following this attack, officially because it was on paper he was incompatible with anyone outside of his twin. With her gone, entering the drift was largely impossible with anyone else. Now he works as a loccent officer in the shatterdome, responsible for being the eyes & ears of the pilots. He has a unique knack for identifying Kaiju after they exit the breach but before any other signs are present.

<center><i>ENTER CLARY. </i></center>

<p>After losing her older sister & being closed off from her brother because of the rumors flying around regarding the truth about <b>WHAT HAPPENED</b> at the Breach, Clary pushed herself harder than anyone ever imagined, defying her mother to enter the Jaeger Academy. Her motives are to <b>LEARN THE TRUTH</b> about what happened down there in the deepest part of the Pacific, her sister’s watery hell, & if that means being the third & final in the Fairchild-Morgenstern line to dive into the Drift & assault the Breach, she’ll do it.

<h4>interaction ideas</h4>
<p><b>option i.</b> <i>meeting in a public space</i>. Hong Kong is considered an open port, & with the consolidation of the PPDC, the staff & pilots of the Shatterdome would be especially integrated with the surrounding area. Places of interest for Clary would include the black market surrounding Reckoner’s bones, Victoria Harbor, Victoria Peak - where you can find her sketching when she’s not training or on duty in the Shatterdome, or Repulse Bay & the beaches.
    
    <p><b>option ii.</b> <i>meeting through work</i>. obviously, any muses connected to the PPDC would have a good chance of meeting her either in the training rooms, LOCCENT Mission Control, in the hallways leading to the Ranger’s bunks, or the cafeterias.
    
    <p><b>option iii.</b> <i>meeting prior to verse canon</i>. his would include meeting Clary prior to her being passed as a candidate for the Rangers, & is open on a <b>plotting intensive basis</b> as an option.

<p><center><a title="to bring Death"><i2>φέρειν φόνον</i2></a></center>

<blockquote>
    <p>she always remembers things out of order. sometimes it’s the crash of the waves on a distance Grecian shore as her ship careens down into darkness & the water swallows her whole. sometimes it’s being burned at the stake after running from an arranged marriage. 

<p>it never lasts but more than an instant - each of those lifetimes cut short by the snap of the threads of fate. there’s only ever the single constant across each of her lifetimes; the motley band of <b>immortals</b> that always seem to find her, or whose path she seems to continually wander into in each & every lifetime.

<p>perhaps another constant is her art. in each lifetime, she finds a new medium or finds a way to refresh another. in this lifetime? it's finally time to return to a classic. Clary works as an artist & travels wherever her feet take her - retracing timeworn paths in the hopes of finding that one <b>missing piece</b> that will spark the return of her memory one more time, so the cycle can start anew.
</blockquote>

<p>her first lifetime, long ago in the 13<sup>th</sup> century BCE, had started her down this path - originally traded as a slave in the greco-roman empire, clary won her freedom & came into service at the temples to take up the mantle of <b>pythia</b>. she would spend several lifetimes in service to the temples as an oracle, each time being reborn & re-installed in the temples while her tenure stretched across the expanse of the ancient world. when her time as the orator of the gods came to a close in 393 CE, she was set free into time, unanchored this time. (1300 BCE until 393 CE.)

<p>she would resurface later in the <b>6<sup>th</sup></b> century, marrying Arthur & overseeing the installation of the round table. She would go on to give him two sons - <b>Amr</b>, & <b>Mordred</b>, but Amr dies tragically of pneumonia. her husband dies, & she lives long enough to see her youngest crowned as his successor before passing away, herself. (500- 540s CE)

<p>The next time the immortals would dream of her wouldn't be until the late <b>700</b>s, & this time she would taken on a very different incarnation. as the Götaland princess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aslaug">Aslaug</a>, the third wife of the viking hero <b>Ragnar Lothbrok</b>, she's kept her mantle of that of an oracle, becoming one of the legenday völva that guided her people & her husband to victory. she would die at the hands of his first wife, <b>Lagertha</b>, at the age of forty one after bearing her husband four children. she was survived by two of her sons, & a grandson. (770s-810s CE.)

<p>her fourth arc begins under the reign of <b>king henry viii</b> in the early 1500s. there, she would rise in the ranks of the nobility, keeping acareful balance to stay involved, but out of the way so as to not raise suspiscion for the gift of prophecy still running through her veins. It was during this time that her memories started to come back more slowly, & later. Where as the dreams had started just days before her sixteenth birthday in previous lifetimes, this time they held off but only enough that she didn't think anything of it. (early 1500s - mid 1500s).

<p>her fifth arc took her out of her comfort zone, living the life as a pirate under the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Bonny">Anne Bonny</a> & exploring the seven seas as she enjoyed a level of freedom she hadn't had in centuries. like her previous lifetime, the dreams started up again later - making her 20 before she dipped her toes into the world of her well-loved immortals, much less remembered their faces & names.

<p>the 1800s would see her sixth incarnation, returning to familiar ground in regency london as the daughter of the contentious & regrettably deceased <b>LORD MORGENSTERN</b>. (see: like from the ashes verse for more info. 1797 until 1830s). 

<p>her final arc brings her to the modern era, where she works as an artist in Manhattan. when in previous lifetimes they had dreamed of her starting on her sixteenth birthday, this time a full decade has already passed. she's <b>well established</b> in the art community for her breathtakingly realistic renderings of historical sites, as well as her knack for predicting where important art-related historical artifacts might present themselves. her memories are tenuous at best, & slow to return, & it's not until a chance encounter with someone thought long-gone that everything starts to fall back into place.

<h4>interaction ideas</h4>
<p><b>option i</b>, <i>meeting in a public place</i>. she can almost always be found in any of the major hubs for art. <b>new york city</b> is her current base of operations - having been born in Manhattan in her current lifetime. <b>paris</b> is a constant favorite with its thousands of galleries, & a city of many old memories across multiple lifetimes, but it's far from the only one. <b>florence</b>, of course, draws her in with her connection to renaissance italy. those are just three of many, many varied options where one can find her wandering in a gallery or sketching & painting to... <i>update</i> an old & beloved favorite.

<p><b>option ii</b>, <i>meeting through the old guard</i>. Clary's cyclical span of rebirth & reincarnation means she'll always be drawn to those she views as the few sources of constancy, particularly <b>andromache</b>**, who she's met several times over.
    <blockquote>
        **for anyone actively writing Andromache, this is obviously up for plotting! my reasoning is merely her constancy as the oldest of the immortals, but I’m open to her running into them entirely by chance because of the nature of her cycle, or a myriad of other ideas!
    </blockquote>

<p><b>option iii</b>, <i>meeting in a previous lifetime</i>. 
    <blockquote>
        <p>- <b>13<sup>th</sup> century BCE</b>, originally traded as a slave in the greco-roman empire, Clary won her freedom & came into service at the temples. she would spend several lifetimes in service to the temples as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia">an oracle</a>, stretching across the expanse of the ancient world until roughly the <b>4<sup>th</sup> century CE</b>.

<p>while her first few lives & deaths occurred within the same geographic location, for some inexplicable reason her immortality is only fractionally complete. after being killed on the temple grounds in the 4<sup>th</sup> century CE, it would seem her immortality had been cut short, & she was finally ready to rest. not even she knows why she was allowed to be reborn four centuries later, or why her immortality <i>changed</i> to a cycle of rebirth.

<h4>description</h4>

<p>The lavish & competitive world of Regency London high society with its intricate rules & dramatic but subtle power struggles. At the heart of this world, high society families compete for royal favors, & to ensure their legacies - often in the form of high class marriages. After the death of the contentious <b>Lord Morgenstern</b> under tantalizingly mysterious circumstances, Clarissa & her older brother were finally ready to shed their mourning colors & re-enter society - just in time for Clarissa to make her <b>debut</b> for the season. 

<p>After being presented to the Queen, Clary was singled out as one of the most eligible young women of the season - & a good thing, too, as it will take an incomparable match to secure her place after her father's rumored dabblings in black magic & the occult.</p>

<p>things were going fine, & she even caught the eye of the young Lord Herondale, though there were some whisperings of a scandal in the attention her brother also paid the young man. all of it seemed to die down, & their wedding & the subsequent ball they threw at the end of the season was something incomparable but the ton was still quite glad when the young couple decided to take <b>A YEAR ABROAD</b> following their marriage. no one could have expected what would happen next.</p>

<p>a widow within the first year of her wedding, Clary returned to London to take over the Herondale estates with the failing health of the family’s aging matriarch & act as guardian to the two sole heirs of the Herondale & Morgenstern lines until they might come of age. she wears the mourning colors <b>LIKE ARMOR</b>, & she’s skeptical of the motives of anyone & everyone who comes near her family - well-intentioned or not.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>interaction ideas</h4>
<p><b>option i</b>, meeting in a public place. 
<blockquote>
    <p>though heavily private after the passing of her husband, Clary makes a point to enjoy the small things in life. as such, she might be found at the opera or the theatre during the week.
</blockquote>

<p><b>option ii</b>, meeting at an event during the season.
<blockquote>
    <p>as is custom, it wouldn't be unusual for Clary to attend 1-2 balls a week during <a title="a six-month period between about November & July when the aristocrats would descend upon London from their country estates in order to secure their status by working their contacts, forming allegiances, buying & selling property.">the season</a>, though she's more likely to err on the side of fewer given her charges & responsibilities. she also might make an appearance at one of the weekly evening parties thrown by a hostess, but it's heavily unlikely she would throw one for herself given her younger charges & her attentiveness to them. these parties mostly ended every night in London between 2 & 4 a.m., except Sundays.
    <p>she might be tempted to throw one later in the spring, though, or as a party for one of her boys.
</blockquote>

<p><b>option iii</b>, introduction through friends.
<blockquote>
    <p>after a formal introduction through friends in passing at a party or event, Clary is open to receiving visitors during morning calls but as she's somewhat removed from societal happenings, this is more true in theory than practice & calling on her might cause a flurry of activity to get something ready. 
</blockquote>

<p><b>option iv</b>, meeting during promenade.
<blockquote>
    <p>As it was essential to be seen at Hyde Park during the promenade hour of 5.00 to 6.00 pm, Clary might sometimes be seen there with her boys, or with a trusted friend if only to keep current with the goings on around her.

<h4>headcanons</h4>

<p>- for non-old guard muses / those looking for a purely period au, please feel free to disregard all tog centric headcanons!
for old guard muses, the same (time period relevant/pervasive) headcanons from her main tog verse apply!

<p>- clary is guardian to both kit & ash in this verse, & many of her decisions are based on caring for them & looking after their needs until such time as they can formally accept their titles & look after their lands. the two boys spend the majority of time with their governesses, but clary is a very active participant in their lives. 

<p>- kit is significantly older than ash, & is nearly ready to take on his adult responsibilities which gives clary a bit of freedom in knowing that the herondale line is secure. in return, kit is comfortable in supporting her because of her connection to his distant cousin. this enables her to keep her freedom without being forced to remarry upon her mourning year’s completion. 

<p>- as a widow, clary enjoys a bit more freedom than her unmarried counterparts might enjoy, leaving her free to conduct her affairs discretely. 

<p>- her official title is <b2>duchess herondale</b2>, stylized as her grace. she’ll become the dowager duchess herondale once kit officially marries & becomes duke herondale officially. 

<p>- clary stays in <b>half mourning</b>, which is marked by grey or lilac coloring, even thought the year mark has come & gone. she does this to note she's not particularly interested in re-entering society to find another match.

<p>- Clary takes breakfast (& usually lunch) with both Kit & Ash every morning, no matter how busy they all are.

<p>- both boys are seen to by a different governess, to accommodate their significant age difference. additionally, Kit has various tutors in a wide range of subjects & Ash will be expected to have the same as he grows older.

<p>- during the london season, she & the boys reside at Hanover Terrace, which overlooks Regent's Park, London. It was built two years prior to the 1813 season by reknown architect John Nash.

<h4>description</h4>
<p>once the guardian of <i2>Tyche</i2>, Clary was the guardian of fortune & prosperity before the destruction of the original silver millennium. the oldest of the senshi, Clary was <i>heir apparent</i> before the birth of princess serenity. this is because her mother was eos, sister to selene.

<p>when the silver millennium fell, Clary died alongside the other guardians & was reborn because of the actions of Queen Serenity on 20<sup>th</sup> century earth. while the other scouts were reborn close to each other, the destruction of Tyche before she could be reborn meant Clary was set adrift. 

<p>being born in Manhattan, Clary grew up a long, long way away from the rest of the senshi. in a way, this was fitting given her status as the <b>spare</b> in case something should happen to Usagi - while she can no longer transform, she can still wield the <i2>silver crystal</i2>.

<h4>headcanons</h4>
<p>- because of her original status as <i>heir apparent</i> prior to Serenity's birth, or the event Serenity & Endymion fail to produce an heir, Clary has the crescent mark on her forehead marking her as part of the moon kingdom's royal family. 

<p>- this verse is influenced by the same <b>greek lore</b> surrounding Queen Serenity as the manifestation of <i>Selene</i>.

<p>- her colors are lilac & olive green.

<blockquote>
    <p>this verse uses Clary's <b>canon variant</b> <i>centurion</i> verse as backstory. for details, you can find that verse under the variant's tab under <b>evening star (alt.) centurion</b>, but no knowledge of her canon is required as any muse she interacts with in this verse would likely be aware of the dimension she comes from.
</blockquote>

<p><b>2007</b>, the battle of the burren. given the sword <b>glorious</b>, Clary & her friends believed this sword would end the second in a series of wars initially waged by her father, but kept alight by the brother she never knew she had. all she had to do was stab her soulmate with the sword, & it would sever the connection between him, & Jonathan. that's what they believed, anyway.

<p><b>it didn't work.</b> instead of severing the connection, Jace & Jonathan both were killed instantly. It ended the war, but drove a wedge between Clary & the rest of the survivors. When she eventually chose to leave & be trained as a Centurion, she opted not to look back. 

<p>finishing training was brutal, but taking up the mantle of a centurion meant the assurance no one could ever get the best of her again. as the Clave's emissary for the more <i>difficult</i> missions, Clary would go on to make a name for herself-- one that would have significant consequences.

<p>ten years after the battle of the burren, Clary would take a mission that ended with a face to face confrontation with Lilith. that would be the last time anyone heard from her - unbeknownst to anyone, Lilith had waited until the perfect moment to strike her revenge. Ripping open a portal, Lilith hurled her through it into an alternate dimension - one without Shadowhunters, Raziel, or the mortal instruments. 

<p>waking up in a New York City that was foreign to her & finding everyone <b>gone</b>, Clary knows that she has to <b>find lilith</b> in <i>this</i> dimension if she ever wants to think of finding her way home. it's a good thing her unique skills still work though - while this world might not know Shadowhunters, demons are still plenty active. Teaming up with hunters means she has access to information, & ammo.

<p>Eventually, that info is going to help her get home. At least, that's her hope -- if the place she calls home even still exists.

<h4>description</h4>
<p>Graduating with honors & earning both her B.A. & M.A., she took a risk & did a nine month <i>artist in residency</i> program with The Whitney Museum. After the conclusion of the program, she would go on to accept a job teaching kindergarten at one of the prestigious private schools in New York City - <i>the mallory school</i>. Her curriculum centers largely around art, & language development following the expectations established by the school. 

<p>During the school year, she works with other volunteers for a nonprofit specializing in guided art therapy for both men & women - youth & adults - looking for support after trauma associated with assault, as well as military <b>veteran groups</b> confronting issues surrounding re-entry to civilian life, post-traumatic stress, & other related things. Typically she oversees one session a week after the conclusion of her school day for each group, with her youth group being on Saturdays, & her adult group on Wednesday nights. 

<p>During the summer, she's often called to act as an artist in residence for various programs through <i>New York Foundation for the Arts</i>. Through these residencies, she's traveled to places such as Cape Town, South Africa, Skowhegan, Maine, & Itaparica, Brazil - the latter of which was funded by grant through her employer in the hopes to bring back ideas for further diversifying their curriculum.

<h4>interaction ideas</h4>
<p><b>OPTION I</b>. <i>meeting in a public place</i>. clary frequently wanders the city doing sketches, so it’s very possible to run into her at various museums, coffee shops, or while she’s navigating the sidewalks after work. places of <b>HIGH INTEREST</b> for her are
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>- the new york botanical gardens
        <p>- the high line
        <p>- the new york public library
        <p>- JAVE JONES ( in brooklyn )
        <p>- additionally, she can also be found at various gallery openings, or at her brother’s restaurant, <b>PER SE</b>.
    </blockquote>
    

<p><b>OPTION II</b>. <i>meeting through work</i>. clary works in manhattan’s upper east at a private school modeled after the brearley school, as well as with various artist in residence programs listed but not limited to above. her artist in residence programs are relatively short, & only occur during the northern hemisphere’s summer months ( late june - early august ), but offer flexibility in that they aren’t restricted to manhattan as the rest of the school year would be.

<p><b>OPTION III</b>. <i>meeting through volunteer work</i>. clary additional volunteers with a nonprofit organization working with youth & veterans. these programs emphasize art therapy, with youth activities on saturdays, & the veteran meetings on wednesday nights.
<br />
<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>
<h4>headcanons</h4>
<p>- Clary's canon backstory in this verse is <b>largely similar</b>&nbsp;to her seemingly mundane life prior to her sixteenth birthday. She was born the younger child of Jocelyn Fairchild &amp; Valentine Morgenstern, but raised solely by Jocelyn in Park Slope, Brooklyn. They had separated following steep personal tragedy that had claimed the life of Jocelyn’s parents when their home burned under mysterious circumstances, &amp; Valentine had bolted with their son.

<p>- She attended&nbsp;<b>St. Francis Xavier School</b>, a private school near her home in Park Slope, Brooklyn, which is where she met Simon Lewis when she was six years old. Additionally, prior to her high school graduation, she was taking classes at&nbsp;<b>NYU's Tisch School of the Arts</b>.&nbsp;


<p>- <b>When she was 16&nbsp;</b>( circa 2007 ), she received a letter from her father’s estate revealing he had passed away far more recently than she &amp; her mother had been lead to believe - Jocelyn had been under the impression her husband had died in that tragic fire that had claimed the life of her parents &amp; young son before the birth of their daughter.&nbsp;Several weeks later, Jonathan turned up on Jocelyn’s doorstep with the revelation that not only had Valentine lied about his own death, but also that of his son.

<p>- <b>Jonathan has been living &amp; working in Manhattan </b>since, compliant with <a href="https://idumean.tumblr.com">@idumean</a>‘s <i>professional chef</i>&nbsp;verse unless plotted otherwise. Jocelyn &amp; Luke are now married &amp; living at Luke’s.&nbsp;

<p>- Clary teaches <b>kindergarten</b>&nbsp;at a private school in <b>Manhattan’s Upper East</b>. Her class size ranges from 8-10 small children, &amp; follows a Scandinavian elementary model that emphasizes playtime &amp; education through discovery. Her school year runs from roughly the second week of September through the first week of June, with her artist in residence programs typically picking up the third week of June through the second week of August. 

<blockquote>
     <p><b>yearly salary: </b>76,000, pretax ( <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/The-Brearley-School-Teacher-Salaries-E150524_D_KO20,27.htm">link</a> ), $60,291 after taxes. works out to roughly <b>$5,024/mo.</b>
</blockquote>

<p>- <b>Clary does not drive</b>.&nbsp;She <i>does</i>&nbsp;however frequently use the metro, as well as very, very rarely takes cabs to get between home &amp; work as well as the various places she goes during the week for her volunteer work or art ramblings. She runs an instagram account based on <b>the rambling sketcher</b>&nbsp;( <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ramblingsketcher/">link</a> ), &amp; sells prints for additional income. she carries an etchr field case with her for those excursions. you can find the rest of the details of her kit here ( <a href="https://www.ramblingsketcher.com/single-post/2020/03/28/Sketch-Kit-2020-Edition">link</a> ).

<p><b>clary's apartment</b>

<p>Clary’s apartment is very much a rare find in NYC. She lives in <b>EAST HARLEM</b>&nbsp;in a small nearly studio apartment that’s perpetually covered in plants &amp; paintings. it’s very small, but it’s one of the most walkable areas &amp; close to public transportation - &amp; it’s home. her rent takes up a disproportionate amount of her income, but she supplements her teacher’s salary with her art work, &amp; various grants cover the cost of her artist in residence excursions that aren’t covered by the programs themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>she has the world’s smallest kitchen ( <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JeTi11R.png">link</a> ), but it’s fully functional - a miracle for many small NYC apartments - &amp; has a gas stove. she supplements it with a small kitchen cart that acts as additional counter space but mostly stores art supplies. she’s more of a baker than a cook, &amp; she leaves the cooking primarily to Jonathan who invades her space like a human tornado once a week to meal prep ( read: use his sister as a human guinea pig for <i>per se</i>’s new dishes ) for his little sister.&nbsp;</p>

<p>her apartment isn’t just covered in art supplies. she’s converted her closet into a sewing workspace, whereas her clothes typically hang on a freestanding rack by her bed. the living room is absolutely taken over by canvases &amp; drop cloths to protect the floor once she gets <i>really into</i>&nbsp;a project. she has a very small table by her window that she uses for grading, but also doubles as a very small breakfast nook, giving her a small oasis where she can have coffee &amp; snag food before dashing out into the chaos of the city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>she doesn’t have any pets, but she <i>does</i>&nbsp;have an abundance of plants. spider plants, jade plants, &amp; an abundance of ferns can be found tucked away either on the scarcely available surfaces, or more recently thanks to Luke, in wall mounted planters or hung from the ceiling. one of her favorites is a small collection of happy bean plants ( <a href="https://img.crocdn.co.uk/images/products2/pl/20/00/03/20/pl2000032044.jpg?width=940&amp;height=940">link</a> ) one of her parents gifted her with after her first year of teaching, as well as an indoor <i>brown turkey</i> fig tree, a dwarf lemon tree, &amp; a dwarf apricot tree, all of which she has absolutely no room for, but they help her feel a little less claustrophobic in the tiny apartment that is <i>significantly</i>&nbsp;smaller than the one she shared with her mother in Brooklyn.</p>

<h4>description</h4>
<p><b>it wasn't always like this</b>. she remembers a time when things were better; there was singing & dancing, a castle lit up under the waves. They may not have been royalty, but her father was one of the <b>ruling elite</b>, & advisor to the Inquisitor herself. She has memories of playing on the reefs with the other children, but all of those ended on the day of her father's <b>uprising</b>.

<p>Despite years of promises by the surface, conditions in the ocean had deteriorated drastically, & Valentine wanted to <i>rise against</i> those on the surface, to show then the true might of the ocean kingdom. Knowing an all-out war, as well as the obvious hazard of revealing themselves, the council voted against such drastic measures. Valentine, having expected this, planned an <b>uprising</b>, intending to take power by killing all in attendance at the signing of <b>the accords</b> - the peace treaty between the kingdoms of the ocean.

<p>His uprising was unsuccessful, largely in part because of the betrayal of his wife & former best friend. The two of them, having tipped off the other kingdoms, hatched a plan to stand against Valentine. Realizing he'd been double crossed, he quickly retreated & left his followers to the massacre. he managed to steal the Consul's tridentin the chaos before disappearing. 

<p>he was apparently killed shortly after, when his grotto collapsed as the guards stormed it to try & recover the trident. he & his young son were supposedly trapped in the rubble, allegedly crushed to death. grieving for her son but suspicious, jocelyn left the kingdom with her daughter. the bodies of valentine & his son, as well as the trident, were never recovered. wherever valentine had hidden it, he had seemingly taken the secret to his grave.

<p>unbeknownst to jocelyn or the others left in the city, jonathan & valentine had not died in the cave in. instead, the collapse was orchestrated by valentine to hide their tracks. he then took his son to the edges of the kingdom & raised him in <b>THE TRENCHES</b> on the very edge to the abyssal zone, forbidding his son from ever going to the surface, or beyond the dark depths of their home.

<p>Jocelyn has not been back to <i>alicante</i>, & Clary has limited memories of it. instead, they've traveled the expansive ocean most of her life, never settling in one place for too long out of fear <i>something</i> might find them.

<h4>headcanons</h4>
<p>Clary's <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ycGfhsN.jpg">tail</a> is green with gold around the edges. She additionally has two pelvic fins on either side, close to her waist, as well as smaller finlets near her tail for stabilization.

<p>she is most closely related to the coelacanth, both in body styling, & evolutionary growth of her fins. 

<p>she can technically shed her tail when entirely dehydrated, giving way to legs. This process is incredibly painful, & should only be used in an emergency -- while she would theoretically regain her tail in saltwater, it could take years for it to be the size & strength it was previously.

<p>she is actually more closely related to humans than fish, despite her appearance.

<p>she can both speak & understand English, as well as a handful of other languages she would have become familiar with due to container shipping ports.

<p>She sources her spices from <a href="http://affcgato.tumblr.com/">Magnus</a>' <b>saffron</b>, & hand-delivers a selection of tea cakes & biscuits to <a href="http://bastxrds.tumblr.com/">Tessa</a>'s <b>infused</b> daily. in fact, it was at <b>infused</b> that she found her partner in crime; <a href="http://bastxrds.tumblr.com/">lucie herondale</a>.

<p>She doesn't dwell on the little things, forgetting most of them as she sees them. Still, <i>a lot</i> of litle things have always popped up, & her sketchbooks are filled with half-remembered daydreams of a world she only catches glimpses of. 

<p>it starts at <b4>pandemonium</b4>. She'd been once before, on her birthday years ago. She'd gotten in with Simon, she remembers, & she's been hooked on this place since. She comes here when she wants to <i>forget</i> her boring, mundane life, & whatever happens in the club, stays in the club.

<p>someone once jokingly told her the <i>silver stuff</i> is a fairy drink. whatever it is, it loosens everything up. that's how she'd met her. they'd never exchanged names, but she'd never considered leaving her side from the moment they started dancing together. 

<p>now it's an unspoken agreement. they meet up a few times a week & dance all night. they've never exchanged names, or anything else, but Clary's stopped ging out & meeting <i>other people</i>. she deleted those stupid dating apps weeks ago, too. even if they only see each other at the club, somehow that feels like enough.

<p>right up until a <b4>scorpios</b4> demon tries to follow her home from work.

<p>She hadn't expected to get scouted for this particular project, but knowing the name behind it, it made a lot of sense. She'd been between gigs, working out of her mom & step-dad's place in Manhattan when <b>Alec Lightwood</b> had given her a call, offering her a spot on the underwater research station <i>mana one</i>. It would be a great gig, he promised - & somewhat of a reunion for the group that had worked out of the institute together for years.

<p><b>jace. alec. izzy. her brother. maia.</b> it felt a little too good to be true, but she'd accepted without too much hesitation. as an acquatic botanist & research biologist, the vibrant underwater life at the station means she has no shortage of projects she can work on. taking turns in the kitchen & in the gliders with her brother, their goal is to study the deep sea environments never before fully mapped with state of the art equipment supplied by <b>the Tanaka Institute</b>.... & programmed by one very mysterious <a href="https://bastxrds.tumblr.com/">Asajj Ventress</a>.

<p>Before the extraction can make it through the Holland Tunnel, an extremeist group targeted them & any other cars waiting to get past checkpoints, blowing the tunnel & isolating egress out of the city. Other bridges were targeted as well, leaving the only route out of the city to the <b>north</b>. 

<p>Most of the transport was killed in the blast. Those that weren't pushed through, including Brendol, making for an alternate escape. It's when they part ways that Hux realizes Clary isn't among the survivors, nor those being evacuated. Turning his back on his father & the expectation of safe extraction, he went back for her & found her hiding in her apartment.

<p>Now the two of them have to get out of the city, evading both the vesps & also the rogue cultist groups now roaming the apocalyptic remains of the city that never sleeps while trying not to acknowledge the awkwardness that comes from the fact they broke up <i>weeks</i> ago & neither of them have moved on at all.

<h4>description</h4>

<p>there are a lot of words for what <b>valentine morgenstern</b> was, but the one absolutely certain thing is that he was effective. While other kids did girl scouts or soccer, Clary & her brother attended wilderness survival workshops, hunting parties, & learned everything to prepare them for the war he kept promising was coming. 

<p>his uprising & the prophecied separation never materialized, for better or worse, & Jocelyn managed to flee with her children while Valentine was too busy arranging yet another wilderness survey just before Clary's sixteenth birthday. With her mother settled in Brooklyn, Clary working her way through school, & Jonathan throwing himself into the culinary world, it would seem that the three Fairchilds could finally start to adjust to something vaguely resembling a normal life.

<p>while she had always loved art growing up, there was a part of her that couldn't shake her father's words entirely. & that's what inevitably lead her to apply for a graduate program in medical illustration at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. 

<p>After too many years away at school, Clary moved back to Manhattan to be close to her remaining family. Everything would have been great, if the world hadn't decided that was the perfect time for everything to go right to hell. ... just like her father had told her it would.

<h4>options</h4>

<p><b2>option i</b2>. as an isolated survivor in the city.

<blockquote>
    <p>Clary spends much of her day scavenging for supplies, so it's heavily possible that someone could run into her while she's pilfering medicine, toilet paper, or food. alternately, she can also be found in the abandoned halls of the Met.
</blockquote>

<p><b2>option ii</b2>. when it all goes down.	
<blockquote>
    <p>As someone living in the city, there's a variety of ways they could meet as things go down - coming to & from work on public transportation, at an event during the news broadcast, or during an attempted evacuation.
</blockquote>

<p><b2>option iii</b2>. at the compound.	
<blockquote>
    <p>if your muse is traveling during the event, it's always possibly they could come across the compound clary & other survivors have holed up in & make a case for asylum.
</blockquote>

<li>
<h4>headcanons</h4>

<p>Clary holds a bachelors in design for sustainability with a minor in Scientific Illustration (focus: botany) from Savannah College of Art and Design, & a masters in medical illustration from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. 

<p>she additionally has a small library composed of all of the books her illustrations have made it into, making for quite the useful treasure trove of plant identification & medical textbooks.

<p>her home is a <a href="http://onthesetofnewyork.com/iamlegendapartment.html">fortified town house</a> in Greenwich Village - 11 Washington Square Park North. it's been outfitted so that the windows are covered by blackout shades, the door is heavily bolted, & the entire building is soundproof unless you're right on top of it.

<p>alternately, variant where she's part of a band of survivors, she & the other survivors have taken over a factory & adjacent warehouse, outfitting it to be the loudest & brightest building in the city in the hopes that that deters creatures from breaching the perimeter.

<blockquote>
    <p>
in this variant, Clary has the same role but works with other survivors instead of staying isolated in her townhouse - though many of her things are still there, & she occasionally braves the city to go & get them as needed because bringing everything would require more manpower than she can handle alone.

<blockquote>
    <p><b>note:</b> I'm comfortable plotting this verse both during & after her time in the Menagerie.
</blockquote>


<p>Originally from the <b2>Wandering Isles</b2>, Clary's mother fled with her after her father's experimentation on her older brother went badly awry & Jocelyn discovered Valentine had started to do the same on her unborn daughter. The would stay on the run for most of Clary's life, fleeing to the <b2>Southern Colonies</b2>in hopes that they may escape his notice. 

<p>They managed for fifteen years before two of her father's associates - <b2>Pangborn</b2> & <b2>Blackwell</b2> - spotted Jocelyn in the market. clary was able to get away, only to be captured by a slave trader. She was pulled aboard, held in irons, & only allowed above deck when they had finally reached Kerch, where she was sold to Tante Heleen's <i>Menagerie</i>.

<p>She spent six months in Heleen's silks before she was able to read her own contract & discovered how much the woman was adding to her own expenses. The realization she would never pay her off made her work harder, testing the limits of the grisha abilities that had manifested in the Colonies, & finding ways to sneak in side jobs. Paying off Heleen should have meant freedom, but instead it was like trading out for a more comfortable cage.

<p>Now she works out of a small attic in the <b2>Zelvar district</b2>, forging documents for a fee & stashing all the money she can get so she might be able to track down her mom, & hoping that she can escape notice of the drüskelle whenever they make berth in Ketterdam's various harbors.

<h4>notes</h4>

<p><b>option i.</b> <i>the Menagerie</i>

<blockquote>
    <p>meeting during her time as the mare in Tante Heleen's Menagerie. Clary not only was forced to carry out the terms of her indenture, but found ways to work her odd little side job - selling expert forgeries & small works of her own art to pad her pockets so that she might escape.
</blockquote>

<p><b>option ii.</b> <i>forger</i>

<blockquote>
    <p>meeting in the <b2>zelvar district</b2> after she's escaped Tante Heleen's, & has started working as a forger in Ketterdam while hiding her status as Grisha. She forges documents - writs of transit, permissions for crossings, false itineraries, as well as works of art. 
</blockquote>

<p><b>option iii.</b> <i>variant</i>

<blockquote>
    <p>meeting in a variant of the verse where Clary was taken to the little palace & trained with other Grisha instead of falling into the hands of slavers in the Southern Colonies. 
</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br>
<br>
</li>

<li>
<h4>headcanons</h4>

<p>- because of her father's experimentation on her, Clary's gift as a <b2>Corporalki</b2> tailor is enhanced. She doesn't just hold the ability to manipulate living flesh, but also has an added ability to work as a <b2>fabrikator</b2> in a very limited fashion. It's these complimentary gifts that allow her to expertly forge documents & works of art.

<p>- her favorite food is the small pineapples that are occasionally brought in from the southern colonies, because they remind her of home. sometimes, after she's completed a significant job, she'll buy them candied & hoard the box away in her attic.

<b>Kaz Brekker</b></a>, <a href="https://crowgreeds.tumblr.com">@crowgreeds</a> &mdash; after leaving the Menagerie, word of mouth brought the <b2>bastard of the barrel</b2> to her door. it started with a few documents - excellently forged - so that he might move shipments in & out of the harbor, before Dirtyhands discovered her talent for art. Now her best words go to him.


</li>
<li>
<h4>locations</h4>
    
<p><div id="left"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HHdVBdm.png"></div>
<b>Southern Colonies</b></a> &mdash; located south of Novyi Zem & belonging to Kerch, Clary & her mother called the colonies home for fifteen years after Jocelyn escaped her husband. It was here in one of the markets near a port city whose name she's long since forgotten that Jocelyn was taken by Pangborn & Blackwell, & Clary was hauled onto a Slaver's ship.

<p><div id="left"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HHdVBdm.png"></div>
<b>The Menagerie</b></a> &mdash; Clary spent six months in Tante Heleen's Menagerie after being forcibly brought to Kerch. She only managed to escape because of her Grisha abilities affording her the ability to take on side work, but those six months (nevermind the time leading up to them, as well) remain some of the most traumatic of her life. She hasn't returned to the West Stave since & refuses work that would mean delivering or walking through that part of Ketterdam. 
    
<p><div id="left"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HHdVBdm.png"></div>
<b>Zelvar District</b></a> &mdash; after escaping the Menagerie, Clary was lucky to find a small place she could call home in the Zelvar District. It's on the border closest to the East Stave in a run down building that's little more than rickety stairs & warped wood, but the attic is warm enough & she has a small window to see one of the neighboring manse's gardens... as well as most importantly, a door that locks.

<h4>description</h4>

<p>raised to believe she's the daughter of two prominent hackers in the matrix, Clary was born after her mother had escaped imprisonment & made it to the human Resistance settlement of Zion. Her father rejected the red pill, choosing to instead stay in the Matrix with her older brother even while rejecting the simulated reality around him. the split in the family was hard, & Clary was raised to believe her mother could never re-enter the Matrix for fear of her father finding her, & having her reinserted. 

<p>growing up with access to Zion's archives, Clary knew from a young age that she had some sort of strange talent that no other potential operator possessed - she could manipulate the <b>construct</b> with ease, going on to expand it & craft it in the form that all operators would go on to use but even more impressive, if perhaps a touch alarming, is her ability to maniplate the Matrix itself. she can only take on little changes - a touch her, a change there - without alerting the Matrix' sentinel programs to her presence, & if she were to ever be discovered, the consequences would be dire.

<p>she's hiding a secret though, one that she learned from the single time she's ventured into the Matrix while her crew was asleep. Clary isn't human - she's a bridge. originally existing in the Matrix as a complex program, her consciousness was downloaded into a human body & allowed to be born into the human world. this knowledge carries a heavy burden, but it explains her unique abilities to manipulate & change the programming of the matrix itself.

<p>she knows that every time she interfaces with the matrix, though, she risks discovery & the machines will do <b>anything</b> to get her back on their side.

<h4>notes on interaction</h4>

<p><b>option i.</b> <i>meeting after rescue</i>.
<blockquote>
    <p>as the operator of one of the hoverships, Clary is one of the first points of contact a newly rescued redpill would have as their body recovers from their rescue. she's trained with medical knowledge, & some other basic skills to help ease their transition into the real world.
</blockquote>

<p><b>option ii.</b> <i>meeting in the Matrix</i>.
<blockquote>
    <p>no one quite understands or knows how it's possible, but Clary possesses a unique ability to cast herself into the Matrix without an injector port. it takes tremendous effort, & carries even greater risk for her than typical crew owing to her father's presence residing in the Matrix so it's not something she does lightly or often - but it remains something she can use as a last ditch option for an emergency.
</blockquote>

<p><b>option iii.</b> <i>meeting in Zion</i>.
<blockquote>
    <p>should a human be rescued by another hovercraft & their crew, Clary & the Finalizer periodically dock in Zion to refuel & grab supplies.
</blockquote>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</li>

<li>
<h4>headcanons</h4>

<p>- clary's unique abilities come from her exposure to machine & matrix program influence before she was born, priming her human body to accept her programmed consciousness. her father offered up both of his children as experiments to <b>the architect</b> in an effort to find a balance to the equation & keep the Matrix from failing. 
    <blockquote>
        <p>- because of this, Jocelyn doesn't realize that her escape was purposefully engineered in the hopes that her unborn child would act as a counterweight to the older child who remained in the Matrix, with both acting as anchorpoints for their different worlds.

<p>no one really knows much about how clary came to be a guest in Kings Landing or a lady the Queen's services, but her recommendations were superb, & she was adequately vouched for by <b>House Rykker</b> in a bid to regain some social standing within the court. In theory, she was a good candidate for keeping the princess in line when she wasn't with her governess - in practice, it's all a bit more complicated than that. 

<p>Clary & her mother fled Essos before she was even born with the help of <b>Varys</b>, crossing the Narrow Sea to land in Duskendale. Jocelyn would eventually give birth to Clary, & the two of them would be invited as guests to King's Landing. In the aftermath of Robert's Rebellion, Jocelyn was able to fly under the radar & establish herself as a valuable ally in the queen's service. Eventually, her daughter would follow - raised alongside Myrcella as an older playmate to the princess.

<p>Like her mother, Clary would eventually fall into Varys' service, becoming one of his Little Birds.

<blockquote>
    <p>This verse is a prequel re-imaging of her main <b>ASOIAF</b> verse.
</blockquote>

<p>after years of living on the run, Clary came to King's Landing by way of crossing the Narrow Sea after her mother was taken from their home when men in the service of her estranged husband attempted to reclaim the egg she had fled Asshai with years prior. It was a lucky thing, that egg - it <i>hatching</i> was the only way the little girl was able to get away from Pangborn & Blackwell. Selling what little the family had left, Clary made for King's Landing with <b>Tessys</b> - the dragon hatched from the egg.

<p>Now in King's Landing, Clary petitioned King Viserys to be allowed to remain at court as a dragonrider, & as lady to the royal household. At first it seemed it would work perfectly, but Tessys was far too headstrong a dragon to be contained - one evening, Tessys escaped the Dragonkeepers & bolted from the dragonpit. He hasn't been sighted since, & now Clary is alone in the Red Keep.

<p>- Clary & her brother are descendants of <b>Aerea Targaryen</b>, the princess who disappeared for a year on the back of Balerion before returning to King's Landing near death. Balerion took the two of them back to Valyria, & upon seeing the wreckage, continued East - bringing them to Asshai. They were caught, & the princess was subjected to deep magic in the shadowlands, only escaping after the shadowbinders took what they needed from her.

<p>- This line would eventually give rise to her father Valentine, & Jonathan.

<p>- like her brother, Clary was also victim to her father's experimentations on her before she was born. she's unaware of this, or what it could mean for her.

<p>Not even New York was safe enough. After fleeing her family home for Paris & then from there to New York, it seemed like Jocelyn Fairchild still could not escape the ghost of a husband she swore couldn’t possibly be dead. nevertheless, they eked out a life in Brooklyn for a while until a chance sighting of Valentine’s associates near their apartment spooked Jocelyn. taking the advice of an old friend, Jocelyn went off the grid shortly before Clary's sixth birthday, disappearing into the heart of Maine. 

<p>Derry itself wasn’t anything to write home about & that’s precisely why Jocelyn figured it would be safe enough for them to live in anonymity. she took up work as a secretary at the women’s health clinic, with Luke slotting himself into a job running a used book store - Back Pages. for a while, everything way fine.

<p>at least until people started disappearing, making Jocelyn wonder if maybe this quiet little town was just as dangerous as the man they were trying to hide from.

<p>several years after the world has gone to hell, Clary works at one of the last outposts for survivors. while some have gone quiet, squeezing out survival in silence, a small group of survivors have shot in the other direction. converting a factory into their living dpace, they've learned that <b>noise</b> is the best defense against most of these creatures, but it comes at a heavy cost. 

<p>they're losing people every year, & supplies are getting harder, & harder to find.

<p><h4>notes</h4>

<p>- Clary's old apartment is in one of the most heavily infested parts of the city, & very difficult to get to. It's currently secured, but her medical journals & textbooks - along with a host of other useful books, seeds, & some vague necessary supplies - were never looted out of it when she was brought to the base of operations. She's never been able to go back to get them, either, even thought the need for them is starting to become urgent.

<p>- north district (north of the outpost)

<p>- south district (south of the outpost)

<p>- waterfall camp (secondary camp, one primary source of food).
